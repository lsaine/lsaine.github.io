<h2 id="title">The End</h2>
<p id="author">&copy; 2016 Anthony Long</p>

<p>The window of his room overlooks Vallejo Street from two floors above the cafe. It is very late. The last drunks have gone, and only the faintest breeze rustles the leaves of the ficus trees across the street. </p>

<p>By the time Chick arrives in a few hours to open up downstairs, things will be settled. The clatter of cups being stacked, the squeaking of tables and chairs being dragged outside, will go unheard in Room 220. John Beerce will, by then, be beyond it all. Nothing disturbs the sleep of the dead, they say.</p>

<p>Better not anyway, Beerce whispers, his throat so dry that the words cleave to the roof of his mouth and die there.</p>

<p>With his hand trembling slightly - the VA doctors out at Fort Miley recently diagnosed the onset of Parkinson's disease - Beerce lights his eight remaining candles. He arranges them in a wide circle around the threadbare mattress set in the middle of the room. He has slept on that mattress since the early seventies when he was driving up and down the coast, living out of a rust-and-gray VW van. He's dragged it with him everywhere since and now they're both here, tired and worn out at the end of the line. It has one more service to perform and then it can rest.</p> 

<p>As candlelight flickers against the pale walls, the faces of young warriors inside the cheap frames become holograms behind the cracked glass, following Beerce as he moves around the room, beckoning to him from long ago and far away. Tonight they seem very close by. With the candles lit and the mattress down, he retrieves a battered cigar box from the shelf. At one time the box held Cubans, and good ones. Now the lid is secured with electrical tape and the ancient paper is peeling and mostly gone. The box contains the sum total of John Beerce: his medals, service documents, a little grass, around forty dollars in cash. He removes his DD 214, the discharge papers he's required to present to the VA doctors in order to be treated for his post traumatic stress. ("What are your worst memories, son?")</p> 

<p>The DD 214 lays it all out: John Beerce, 173rd Airborne Brigade, certified expert sharpshooter and machine gunner. Charlie Company, 2nd Platoon, 4th Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, engaged almost continually with the enemy up there in D Zone. Distinguished service as a rifleman, then a gunner. A genuine war hero, the real McCoy, with the medals to prove it: two Bronze Stars, two Purple Hearts, the Army Commendation Medal with V device for valor. Combat Infantryman Badge and the Vietnam Service Medal. His jump wings - the Parachutist Badge - and Expert Marksmanship Qualification Badge, with Rifle Bar. Gunner Badge 1st Class, with Mortar Bar. There's more: a Meritorious Unit Commendation and a Gallantry Cross with Palm Unit Citation presented by his grateful South Vietnamese allies.</p>  

<p>But the DD 214 doesn't tell the whole story. It doesn't mention the blue valium for the combat fatigue, quinine for the malaria, or penicillin for the clap. Shot twice, booby trapped, dinged with shrapnel too many times to count. ("Taking a Purple Heart for the shrapnel? That's chickenshit. You scrape it out and rub some alcohol on it, that's all.") Contaminated by agent orange, with three decades worth of surgeries to remove tumors and cysts to show for it. The lymph nodes in his neck, gone. </p>

<p>The medals and commendations listed on the DD 214 only hint at the hard combat Beerce saw up in the Highlands. He got his first kill as they thrashed on the ground, using his boy scout clasp knife to saw through the man's windpipe. He killed a lot more after that: On night ambush along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a search-and-destroy mission. Beerce on the .50 caliber, feet propped up on an ammo box and dozing when suddenly the trip flares start going off. Wide awake now and not twenty meters away the enemy illuminated in the flare light. ("There were, I don't know, thirty Cong. There's a regular officer leading them, NVA, with the forage cap and neckerchief they used to wear, like a boy scout. I opened up - BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! - and a bunch of them just dropped. Didn't get the officer, though; at least, we didn't find him later. Too bad. I wanted that hat. Maybe we could have retrieved his orders, too, and I could have made rank. Oh, well. Win some, lose some.")</p>

<p>The DD 214 doesn't say anything about the shock of losing, either. ("You see your buddies killed and then you <i>lose</i> the war? What did they die for? You've been brainwashed to win so you take losing pretty hard. And we weren't losing, not when I was there. We were kicking ass.") And getting their asses kicked. Too many buddies choppered out for good, both the dead and wounded. Beerce remembers picking up the M-60 from Ramirez, KIA, and making them pay. </p>

<p>He lays his medals out on the floor, making a ritual of it, making a circle within a circle inside the candles. He finds his old scout knife in the box, too, unfolds the blade, and places it at the head of his mattress. Almost as an afterthought, he takes the three-by-five American flag off the wall and folds it most tenderly into a neat triangle. He places the flag next to the knife.</p>

<p>In five hours, Ned Forrest and Ed Olinsky and Michael Argonne will be downstairs drinking coffee and shaking off the effects of their evening revels. Beerce has known them a long time. Michael Argonne talks about the war sometimes, reminding everyone that he's a vet, too. But bleeding from a paper cut sustained in the quartermaster's hut at Tan Son Nhut air base is a long way from getting shot up in the jungle, so he clams up whenever Beerce is around. </p> 

<p>Beerce smiles and shakes his head, then sharply sucks air. It's that stitch again. Now here's something he won't miss. It strikes sporadically, usually when it's cold, piercing his left side like an ice pick. It's where he got hit during a soggy firefight on the edge of a fetid swamp, the night they got ambushed on lower ground and half his squad was killed. Hit, barely two days after returning to the line from a field hospital, where he'd spent the previous week being patched up after being shot the first time. Drilled twice inside of three weeks. The pain comes and goes, a lingering reminder in case he might forget. But Beerce never forgets. Odd, he thinks. It isn't cold tonight. </p>

<p>Beerce was there for the only airborne combat jump of the war. They made it early in his first tour and they made at it night. They would be operating behind the enemy, or, more accurately, in the midst of the enemy since there were no static lines. He still hears the rattling of the plane and feels the throb of the engines as they approach the drop zone. Some of them drop acid before leaving the C-47 and they're tripping by the time they've pulled in their chutes. Beerce did. At some point there's chaos, bullets flying directly at him, elongating into multi-colored, flashing serpents as they miraculously bend around him and whistle past. Wherever he turns, or has the sensation of turning, the bullets keep coming, always morphing into snakes that veer off just before impact. This is what he remembers of the trip, aside from the sensation of being squeezed from a tube as it ends. He also remembers its duration, which seems interminable even now, and the cold fear that gripped him as he emerged into the light. It's a fear that follows him through the rest of his war and never entirely leaves him. </p>

<p>Beerce opens the top drawer of the battered dresser and removes two bundles wrapped in oilcloth. He places them both in front of him and avoids looking in the mirror. After weighing their respective merits, Beerce settles on his old Browning, a smaller caliber .22. Its effect at this range, he reasons, is just as reliable as the .357, but requires less in the way of cleanup. The thought occurs to him that regardless of what he uses, after this no Chinese will ever rent the room again. Rooms where the dead have lain, especially in violent death, spook them. Bad joss. Well, good. Maybe that will open up a spot for Roy, who's down on his luck again and can't seem to keep a roof over his head. Roy probably wouldn't mind flopping in Beerce's old room for a while. He'll tolerate the presence of a troubled spirit in exchange for a little warmth. Winter's on the way. </p> 

<p>Beerce unwraps the Browning and gently places it on top of the oilcloth. He returns the other bundle to the drawer. Then, picking up the weapon, he coolly turns it over in his hands before sliding in a fresh clip. A detailed inspection isn't really necessary; he knows everything is greased for action. It's just the habit of a lifetime. If Beerce takes care with anything, it's his guns. </p>

<p>Now he looks in the mirror. His lean, craggy face appears more gaunt than ever, his sallowness more gray than yellow. Deeply set eyes, ringed by dark circles, recede even further into his head. In the candlelight they look like extinct volcanoes. They're vacant, showing no signs of life. He's a skull. Why waste the round, Beerce thinks. I'm already dead.</p>

<p>It's been months since he's felt able to work, months since he has done anything besides drift in and out of the cafe. He can't sit still long enough for any of the live modeling he used to do at the Art Institute and he's too tired these days to hire out for any wiring or electrical work. Imagine humping an M-60 down a jungle track now. The VA doctors give him lithium for the depression but that doesn't do anything except burn like iron as it courses through his body. Still looking in the mirror, he thinks, a fine specimen you turned out to be. </p>

<p>His skin is dry and scaly. His cheek twitches involuntarily and his jaw muscles work without purpose. His mind races. That old saying: There are no atheists in foxholes. Not true. I was. I expected to die out there, and I knew what would be waiting for me when I did. Nothing. God's not here tonight, either. Absent without leave, our lord is. That's because the man does not exist. But...what if I'm wrong? What if squeezing that trigger really fucks me? Will I have to do this again, live it all over again, pay some kind of karmic penance? What if the monks are right and the rest of this crap follows me to wherever I'm going, into some other life? Is there more than physical death? Is there emotional death, too? Spiritual? Does consciousness die, or does it dog you forever? You die, you're gone. But gone where? Shit, what if it's worse there than it is here? I must be new at this. An old soul wouldn't be worrying about all this shit. If I'd lived the ages, I'd slip these bonds easily and be gone. But I'm not doing that, man. I'm punching and fighting all the way. Hanging on. Hanging on for what? Not for dear life, that's for sure. </p>

<p>Beerce is a wraith. Sweat-soaked and shirtless, he glistens in the candlelight.</p>

<p>Old soul. What kind of bullshit is this? You live and then you die. Death is final. I've seen death up close. I see it every night in my dreams. Every night. Faces. Friends and enemies alike, all dead. There's nothing spiritual about it. Death is final. It's the living who go on suffering. When Ramirez got himself killed out there, that was it for him. I was the one who had to pick up the machine gun, to keep on going, wearing fatigues soaked in his blood. He was out of it, but not me. Death is peace. One good squeeze and...sweet oblivion. </p>

<p>Beerce thinks about Melanie. They've been together, for what? A year? Things haven't been so great between them lately but he knows this will really knock her out. He doesn't know why she has chosen to stay and sometimes she doesn't seem very happy that she has. All this Vietnam drama, it gets to her, he knows, wears her down. Years before, Beerce thought he might write a book about the war, write about the guys he'd known and the things he'd seen and done. Other vets have written about the war, even a guy right here in the neighborhood. Beerce'd write a book, too, tell his story, clear his head, move on. But he never quite got around to doing it. Now it's too late. Anyway, by the time Melanie came along he'd lost his diaries and it had been years since he'd written a word. But he still keeps on talking about the book he's going to write. That gets on her nerves, too.</p>  

<p>This will really knock her out, though. </p>

<p>Beerce yawns. He yawns again. He begins shaking all over so he takes the gun and sets it down on the mattress beside him. Steady, now. Steady. He closes his eyes and tries to calm his nerves.</p>

<p>After that, he must have dozed.</p>

<p>It's the garbage trucks that wake him, intrusive and careless, unwelcome heralds of a new dawn. One candle has burned itself out. The others are on their last legs. Guess I'll have to buy some more today or tomorrow, Beerce says out loud, standing and stretching. He goes to the window and watches the neighborhood slowly coming to life. Chick shows up a little after six. He waves when he sees Beerce staring down at him. Beerce waves back. In a little while, Beerce can hear the sounds of Chick getting ready to open the cafe. He blows out what's left of the candles, flops back on the mattress, and dozes a little more. By eight he is up, splashing cold water on his face.</p>

<p>Beerce tidies up, straightens the room. The last thing he does is remove the clip and safe the weapon. He carefully returns it to its oilcloth shroud and places it in the bottom dresser drawer alongside the .357. Then he slips out the door and goes gingerly downstairs to the Caff&eacute; Trieste. The usual suspects are there, and they are glad to see him. </p>
