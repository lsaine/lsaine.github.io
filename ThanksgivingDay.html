<h2 id="title">Thanksgiving Day</h2>
<p id="author">&copy; 2016 Anthony Long</p>

<p>It's seven-thirty in the morning and Ned Forrest finds himself standing in line behind Nick Pantangelo at the Caff&eacute; Trieste. This is Nick's first Thanksgiving Day alone for many years. His longtime live-in girlfriend, Mae, threw him out in the summer, keeping their young daughter, and if he thinks it's been lonely up till now, well...Happy holidays, Nick.</p>
	<p>Ned, a veteran of divorce, takes a furtive peek at Nick in the mirror that stretches behind the counter. That ship's lost its rudder, Ned thinks. He recognizes the look on Nick's face. He remembers it well, having seen it plenty of times in his own shaving mirror during those first years out. With time he's made the adjustments you make so that the holidays pass with relative serenity. But you don't forget that aching chasm of loneliness, ever. Ned looks at Nick again and his heart goes out to him. </p>
	<p>Nick catches Ned looking at him and drops his eyes. A second later he's having a coughing fit. It's a diversion that doesn't fool Ned but he plays along. "Man, I've seen glaciers that move faster than this line does," he says, as if neither of them had ever stood here before. Nick coughs once more then grunts. He's preoccupied.</p>
	<p>Ned has to ask.</p>
	<p>"Got any plans for today?"</p>
	<p>Nick Pantangelo sighs. His answer isn't convincing.</p>
	<p>"Well, I'm invited to a friend's house at four o'clock, but I don't think I'll go," he says.</p>
	<p>"Yeah? Why not?"</p>
	<p>"Ahh, I don't know. Now that I'm finally free, I guess I don't want to feel tied to an agenda. It's been a while since I was free," Nick says, emphasizing the second "free."</p>
	<p>"Okay," Ned says. "Enjoy."</p>
	<p>After the line moves up a couple of feet, Nick says, "I think maybe I'll hop in the car and take a drive to Monterey. I've always liked it down there."</p>
	<p>"Yeah," Ned says. "Me, too."</p>
	<p>"There's this French restaurant in Pacific Grove that's pretty good. I could have dinner there, maybe stay overnight. I should give Asilomar a call and see if they've got a room."</p>
	<p>"Sure," Ned says. "Live it up."</p>
	<p>"There's this place in Carmel" - some memory of it stops Nick, brings him up short, then he smiles at Ned and shakes his head - "Anyway, they serve up a pretty decent breakfast. I'll go there in the morning and then head back up the coast." He looks out the window and pretends to gauge the sky. "Looks like we'll have good weather for it."</p>
	<p>"Well, you can't beat Highway 1, no matter what the weather's like," Ned says. The guy in front of Nick orders three lattes and a couple of cappuccinos, plus five bagels, toasted. Ned looks at the floor and says, "So your kid's with Mae today, I guess."</p>
	<p>"At Mae's father's place, yeah," Nick says matter of factly. "Over in the East Bay. Mae and her sister do all the cooking, ever since her mom died."</p>
	<p>"That sounds nice," Ned says.</p>
	<p>"When her mom was alive it would be the whole clan. It was a real goatfuck, you know? A lot of her relatives are jerks, but it was all right." Nick peers over the shoulder of the guy in front of him to check on the progress of those lattes. "After her mom died, well, it was just Mae's dad and her sister and the three of us. But, yeah, it was nice. It was always nice."</p>
	<p>"I think a drive down to Monterey sounds pretty nice, too," Ned says.</p>
	<p>Ned strains to remember what Mae looked like. Like a lot of women tied to Trieste regulars, she tended to give the place a pretty wide berth. Ned's seen her maybe twice all these years and he recalls a vaguely mousey woman with dirty blonde plaits, a shapeless dress, not much of a smile. Nick met her one rainy night downtown at the lobby bar of the St. Francis Hotel and ended up driving her out to her place in the Avenues. A month or two after that he moved in with her. That was maybe ten years ago. The little girl must be six or seven now. And Nick's back in the neighborhood, living in a place that's more Chinatown than North Beach.</p>
	<p>"Life's cyclical," Ned says in a philosophical moment. If Nick hears him, he doesn't say anything. </p>
	<p>They finally get their coffee and sit down. A couple of regulars, cafe acquaintances, occupy the adjoining table but they're deep into a crossword puzzle. Ned looks at Nick and notices how his big, shaggy friend has aged visibly in these few months, jowls sagging and mouth drooping. He's looking into his coffee cup, like there's something swimming around inside of it.</p>
	<p>"A penny for your thoughts, Nick," Ned says.</p>
	<p>Nick grunts again. He leans over to the next table. "Hey, Edie, mind if I look at the Bay Area section?" Edie looks up from her crossword and gives Nick a big smile. "Sure thing, sugar booger. Happy Thanksgiving," she says, including both of them in the salutation.</p>
	<p>"You, too," Ned says. Nick nods.</p>
	<p>Ned watches Nick scan the headlines, absorbing nothing. In a few hours the Dallas Cowboys will be playing the Philadelphia Eagles and Ned's having friends over to watch the game and share a pre-ordered, pre-cooked turkey dinner. It's a tribal ritual he began hosting a few years ago, the kind of lost-boys-at-Thanksgiving-Day potluck that would be perfect for a guy in Nick's situation. Only, Nick has burned his bridges with a couple of the guys who will be there, so inviting him up is probably just asking for trouble. Nick has always been good at that...burning his bridges. Actually, he's not the easiest guy to like, period. Ned doubts that anybody has invited Nick over at four o'clock. Nick has few friends. Ned's nice to him because he feels sorry for him and because he has a high tolerance for certain kinds of dysfunctionals, guys like Nick who struggle with their anger but are mostly harmless. Still, Ned was surprised that it took Mae ten years to chuck him out.</p> 
	<p>If Nick came up to Ned's place today something bad would happen for sure. Nick would find a reason to start an argument, or someone would remember his simmering grudge against Nick, or Nick would grab a drumstick before anyone else had even seen the turkey. Anyway, nothing good would come of it. Nothing good at all.</p>
	
	<p>Ned finishes his coffee. Standing up, he blows Edie a kiss. Nick looks up from his newspaper, expectantly. In that moment, Ned realizes that Nick is not only aware of the potluck but is hoping for an invitation. He feels that tug of compassion that he always feels for people in pain. Their eyes lock. Nick's are moist and glowing, but his gaze is steady. There's an almost imperceptible nodding of his head, as if he's willing Ned to make the invitation. Ned holds Nick's gaze for as long as he can, smiling all the while. Silently, Nick beseeches him. Ned wavers, is resolute, then wavers again. Finally...</p>
	<p>"Enjoy that drive to Monterey, Nick," Ned says, turning for the door. </p>
	<p>And the light in Nick's eyes is extinguished.</p>
