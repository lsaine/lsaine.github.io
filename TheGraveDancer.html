<h2 id="title">The Grave Dancer</h2>
<p id="author">&copy; 2016 Anthony Long</p>

<p>Mayor Umber was dead. He expired in the depths of a January downpour, clenched in the bosom of his final, horrified, nameless mistress. That was how the hyenas of the press reported it anyway, citing unnamed sources.</p>

	<p>The following morning John Beerce burst into the Caff&eacute; Trieste, his regular North Beach haunt, wringing wet from the rain and clutching the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>'s soggy Extra in his fist. Ink ran down his arms. He was exultant.</p>
	
	<p>"Ding dong," he sang, wildly offkey. "Ding dong, the witch is dead."</p>
	
	<p>This earned Beerce some indulgent laughter and a round of sarcastic applause. A few latte glasses were raised in a mock toast. Those who didn't share his feelings - there weren't many - looked at each other and held their tongues.</p>
	
	<p>Beerce's loathing of San Francisco's suddenly late chief executive was well known around the place. It wasn't Wylie Umber's philandering that bothered Beerce, or even his reputation, polished over the decades like heirloom silver, of being a crooked machine politician. For Mayor Umber, recreational fornication and cronyism were merely the perks of power. No, what cut Beerce was Umber playing the populist to get himself elected, then running the town like a Nevada brothel keeper: You pay, you play; otherwise, get out.</p> 
	
	<p>In his haste to embrace the developer money and the stock market jackpots of the newly privileged, Umber turned his back on people who had lived here for decades and could no longer keep pace. It was a second gold rush. Speculators came pouring in from all points on the compass, scooping up the tiny hillside apartments and modest railroad flats, turning them into smart condominiums, equipping them with gourmet kitchens and Mediterranean-tiled bathrooms, then flipping them to the nouveau riche whose town this had become. </p>
	
	<p>Beerce was among the many forced to clear out - "Ellised" was the verb, in honor of the author of the act that made it easier for landlords to shed their inconvenient tenants - when his comfortable building was sold and converted into "luxury condominiums tailored to your exciting urban lifestyle." The precious little stability he had known in his adult life centered on this small apartment and one day it was just gone. Beerce, an airborne trooper who had done two tours in Vietnam, felt things deeply. He didn't know who Ellis was but he knew who Umber was and fixed the blame on him.</p>

	<p>At the Caff&eacute; Trieste, where high rollers were scarce, Umber's mayoralty was endured with sang-froid by most of the patrons. Although Umber frequently strutted around North Beach and had some pretty powerful friends there, he was not <i>of</i> North Beach. The denizens of Trieste, and their concerns, were of no interest to Mayor Umber. Cab drivers and would-be screenwriters don't fill political coffers; artists and drifters and dreamers have no clout. To Umber, they were as worthless as the semi-coherent dross he delicately stepped over as he hustled off to the clubby confines of Tosca in his trim, size seven Gucci loafers.</p>
	
	<p>Umber never heard of John Beerce, so he couldn't know how avidly some of the more Machiavellian twists of his career had been followed. But he snubbed Beerce once, out on Columbus Avenue, and Beerce had never forgotten it. It was during one of those Italian festivals with neighborhood beauty queens and vintage cars and the local mortuary band playing, and Mayor Umber was the grand marshal. The festivities concluded, the mayor and his retinue were on the scoot to Tosca, walled off by a phalanx of towering bodyguards moving in a cloud of arrogance, when Beerce, wearing a chest full of medals on a frayed fatigue jacket, approached. </p>	
	
<p>"I'm a veteran, Mr. Mayor," he said, beginning his carefully rehearsed appeal to reason. "I fought for this country and now I'm being forced out of my apartment so some yuppies can move in."</p>

	<p>Mayor Umber never broke stride, never looked Beerce's way. Chances are he never even heard him as it was crowded on the street and his focus was most likely fixed on that first martini. But one of the bodyguards, looming and cut and slick, brought Beerce up short with a quick elbow jab, then turned to face him as if to say, Well, soldier boy, what are you going to do about it? Specialist Fourth Class John Beerce of forty-five years ago would have done plenty about it, but all those other years, the ones spent in a cellophane haze of coke and alcohol, had pretty much emptied the tank. There wasn't much he could do, except watch Mayor Umber recede into the crowd. And then retreat to his tiny room in the residential hotel above the Caff&eacute; Trieste that was now his home, where the only pictures on the walls were taken a long time ago, at war.</p> 
	
	<p>"I'm going to dance on that bastard's grave," Beerce announced to the cafe that rainy morning. "I'm going to crack open a bottle of Dom Perignon and do a fandango on Umber's moldering corpse."</p>
	<p>"You're an idiot, Beerce," said Ned Forrest, not bothering to look up from his newspaper.</p>
	
	<p>"The happiest idiot you'll ever see," Beerce replied, pirouetting clumsily while everyone laughed. In addition to getting himself shot up a couple of times, Beerce had contracted malaria late in his second tour and come home gaunt and gray-yellow. The pallor never really left him and thirty-odd years of living rough hadn't helped. This lanky ghost made an unlikely Nijinsky. Everyone laughed some more. </p>
	
	<p>"Why don't you just buy yourself a peg leg and get it over with?" said Ed Olinsky, the lawyer. </p>
	
	<p>But Beerce meant what he said. He would dance on Mayor Umber's grave. It would mean waiting a few weeks, but Beerce, who nurtured bile like it was twenty-five-year-old Scotch, was a patient man. First they had to get Umber buried, a Herculean task considering the little man's monumental stature. Because he was still the sitting mayor when he died, Umber spent a couple of days laid out beneath the cavernous rotunda at City Hall. It was a setting befitting a nobleman. A king. Mayor Umber would have approved. </p>
	
	<p>Flamboyant enough in life, in death Mayor Umber was positively resplendent. Dressed for the occasion in a dark blue Brioni suit, the last freebie he would ever receive from celebrity clothier Clyde Drago, Mayor Umber cut a regal figure in his casket of pure, screw-the-rain-forest teak. City employees, many of whom owed their jobs to Umber's patronage, were the first to pay their respects, filing in behind their supervisors like dutiful German bureaucrats. Those who favored hats, as the mayor had, doffed them as they passed. Some appeared genuinely moved, while others seemed to be there simply to make sure that Umber really <i>was</i> dead.</p>
	
	<p>After the minions, the doors were thrown open to the city at large. Thousands passed the flower-strewn bier. Beerce's turn came and he stared into the coffin. "I'll be seeing you, asshole," he muttered while a Bach cantata filled the rotunda. He flicked a discreet paper clip into the casket, giggling to himself as he moved on.</p>

	<p>The funeral followed two days later. To no one's surprise, they took Mayor Umber straight to the top of the hill, to Grace Cathedral, where the city's movers and shakers are traditionally dispatched to Valhalla. You only die once, Umber said not long before he actually did, so get it right.</p> 
	
	<p>All the city brass were there, along with prominent pols, friend and foe alike. Polite society, which owed much to Mayor Umber, turned out in their morning-coat finery. Commoners who felt the need to grieve showed up, too, although few had luck getting through the heavy cathedral doors and were mostly left milling around outside in a persistent drizzle. There were celebrities: A famous comedian-turned-actor smiled and waved as he threaded his way through the throng. A couple of retired Forty-Niners signed autographs near their rented limousine, double-parked on Taylor Street. The morbid and the curious dropped by to gawk and to mug for the cameras, which greedily filmed the scene for the evening newscasts. And when they had finished their primping and their sound checks, the TV reporters mustered suitably somber expressions before turning to face those same cameras.</p> 
	
	<p>The service lasted four hours because there was a lot to say about Mayor Umber. The encomiums - some sincere, most self-serving - flowed like wine. Then the coffin, sealed tight, was taken from the cathedral and bundled into the waiting hearse. It was the longest funeral procession in anyone's memory. Nearly one hundred black limousines, with Mayor Umber's hearse at their head, snaked through the streets, bearing the departed on a valedictory ride through his old dominions before heading out to Colma, city of the dead. The cortege passed through most of the nicer neighborhoods; owing to time restraints many others, regrettably, had to be left out. Dusk was gathering before they reached the final resting place. </p>
	
	<p>Mayor Umber's gravesite dominated the crest of a small hillock at Woodlawn Cemetery. Like his condo on Nob Hill, it commanded the highest ground in the vicinity, guaranteeing that for the rest of eternity Mayor Umber would remain master of all he surveyed. At first there would only be a temporary marker to tell visitors who slumbered here. It would take some time for the stonecutters to finish a grander, more permanent monument. </p>
	
	<p>After the earth had settled, a faux marble slab was laid atop the grave as a kind of dignity placeholder. The story was duly reported in the <i>Chronicle</i>, which also ran a picture of the slab on page three.  </p>
	
	<p>"Time to dance," Beerce said.</p>
	<p>"You're an idiot, Beerce," Ned said.</p>
	<p>"They'll arrest your sorry ass," said Olinsky, the lawyer.</p> 
	<p>Beerce took Grover Lovejoy with him in order to provide a photographic record of his <i>Totentanz</i>, as he had begun calling it.</p>
	
	<p>"What kind of dance are you going to do?" asked Grover as he unloaded his camera gear. "Jeez, the light's crappy here. This goddamned tree doesn't help." He looked up into a blackened sky and scowled. </p>
	
	<p>"A great day for black-and-white photography," Beerce said, hoisting a bottle of champagne from his knapsack. "Captures the mood." He was excited. "I'm going to do a flamenco. I've been practicing with Francisco over at the Bodega. You'll need a fast shutter speed, man. My feet will be flying."</p>
	
	<p>Retying his gray ponytail, Beerce took a disc player out of the knapsack. While he fished around for the CD, a slender, bespectacled young woman came walking down the path toward Mayor Umber's grave. She approached the slab, carrying a pink nosegay, and regarded Beerce and Lovejoy without interest. Setting the flowers down, the woman, who appeared to Beerce to be somewhere in her early thirties, began muttering what sounded like an incantation. Suddenly she stopped praying and drew her head back, hawking up a wad of phlegm as she did. Then, propelling her face forward, she let loose a world-class loogie. Her aim was true. Beerce marveled. </p>
	
	<p>When she turned toward them again, her eyes alighted on Lovejoy's camera. </p>
	<p>"You guys reporters?"</p>
	<p>"Sure, why not?" Beerce said. "You knew him, evidently."</p>
	<p>"Oh, I knew him all right. He was a louse and he screwed me."</p>
	<p>"Take a number, lady."</p>
	<p>"I mean he fucked me over. I lost a good job because of that bastard." She stuck out a hand. "Melanie."</p>
	<p>Mayor Umber liked finding cushy jobs for his various proteges. One of them, a sturdy little blonde, took a fancy to Melanie's spot in the mayor's Office of Protocol. It was over quickly.</p>
	<p>"Why the flowers, Mel?"</p>
	<p>"Don't call me that. He did," Melanie said, jerking her thumb at the slab. She shrugged. "Irony." She took a closer look at Beerce. Her eyes narrowed. "So what are you guys doing here? You're not reporters, that's for sure. Not in those clothes."</p>
	
	<p>"I'm going to dance on Umber's grave," Beerce said. A smile brightened Melanie's face for the first time and she clapped her hands delightedly, like a child. "I majored in dance," she said, smoothing back her copper-colored hair that she still wore in a dancer's bun.</p>
	
	<p>"The first one I do alone," Beerce said, wiping Melanie's loogie off the slab with a tissue.</p>
	
	<p>She laughed. "Sorry. If only I'd known..."</p>
	
	<p>Melanie watched Beerce attach two tiny speakers to the disc player, then slip into a pair of worn tap shoes he'd picked up at Thrift Town. Finally, he donned Francisco's old flamenco jacket but it hung too loosely on his skeletal frame. He tossed it aside. The ruffled tuxedo shirt, cappuccino-colored and freshly pressed, would have to do.</p>
	<p>"Ready, Grove?"</p>
	<p>"Let 'er rip."</p>
	
	<p>Beerce hit play, hopped up on the slab and said to Melanie: "You're a dancer. Judge the heart, not the technique."</p>
	
	<p>It was a gavotte that began slowly, hypnotically. Beerce struck a haughty pose that Grover, lying on his belly, enhanced dramatically by framing him against the lowering sky. As the guitars gained in intensity, Beerce swung his arms to and fro and brought his feet down - hard - first one, then the other. </p>
	<p>"Wake up, motherfucker," Beerce said. </p>
	
	<p>He was clumsy and amateurish, but had learned just enough during his crash course to move in 4/4 time with the music. Melanie, judging the heart, found no fault with his performance. Beerce tapped, capered, and galloped. He hopped, bounced, and shimmied. But every time he landed on the slab Beerce landed hard, grinding his heel into the stone and cursing the man who lay beneath it. With eel-like grace, Grover and his camera moved with Beerce, capturing everything. "We're talking coffee-table book here," Grover said to Melanie, who clapped in time with Beerce's ferocious stomping. </p>
	
	<p>When he finished, he swept Melanie onto the slab. "I'm not much of a hoofer but I can probably manage a waltz. Wanna dance?"</p>
	<p>"Delighted," Melanie said.</p>
	
	<p>They danced in silence because it's hard waltzing to flamenco but Grover, following them through his viewfinder, was charmed at the way they moved together. They made a perfect graveyard Rogers and Astaire, this pale, lithe dancer and the malaria-wracked infantryman. Even in this bizarre context, or more likely because of it, Grover knew he was making beautiful pictures.</p>
	
	<p>They paused to share some champagne with Grover. Then they remounted the slab where, with Melanie's help, they performed a foxtrot, another waltz, and a stately minuet. They were still dancing when the watchman showed up with the cops.</p>
	
	<p>"Olinsky says you'll probably get off with a fine," Ned said to Beerce that evening after posting their bail. "He figures they'll drop the trespassing, since technically it wasn't, and just hit you with malicious mischief. And since they're going to replace the slab anyway, you probably won't have to cough up any damages."</p>

	<p>"That's great, Ned. Just great."</p>
	<p>"You're an idiot, Beerce," Ned said.</p>
	<p>Beerce smiled down at Melanie. "I know, man."</p>
