<h2 id="title">Dry</h2>

	<p>It sits there, fat and amber, beckoning to Ned from the bar back like a twenty … no, forty … dollar hooker. Ned licks his lips in the way a man coming out of the desert would lick them, his tongue rolling thickly along the dry, cracked crevices, tasting the salty tang. He stares at the Scotch with unconcealed lust. Scotty ambles over, smiling, and leans friendly on the plank. “The usual?” From behind him, Ned feels a restraining hand fall firmly on his shoulder. There’s a catch in his throat as he chokes out the words: </p>
	<p>“Gimme a ginger ale.”</p>
	<p>“Good boy.” John Beerce’s voice is smoothly insincere as he loosens his grip. Ned turns and watches him take a long pull on a Guinness. Beerce wipes the foam from his lips with the back of his hand and delicately belches.</p>
	<p>“Hang in there, man,” he says between quaffs, patting Ned’s shoulder again. “You’ll make it.”</p>
	<p>“Sure you will,” Michael Argonne says, hoisting his martini. “Cheers.”</p>
	<p>Whatever else North Beach may be, it’s a lousy place to give up the demon rum when you a.) like to drink, and b.) live your social life in bars, hanging out with hard drinkers who have no intention of quitting, and alcoholics who have no hope of it. But Ned is going to the beat the odds this time. He’s going to be the goddamn Rock of Gibraltar. </p>
	<p>Doctor’s orders, in fact. He’s carrying too much weight, thanks to a steady intake of lardy restaurant food and Black Label. The humorless medico wants him to drop twenty-five pounds and get his cholesterol level down to something approaching manageable, and he looks and feels like hell. Well, who wouldn’t, with a couple of broken marriages, a broken career, an army of creditors in hot pursuit, and a string of hopeless affairs behind him? Who wouldn’t get soaked now and then? He’s not pounding it every night but when he does, whoo boy, there’s no trip switch with this guy. Nothing that clicks inside, nothing that says, “Hey, fat boy, you’ve had enough.” And like most of the drunks who wash up in North Beach at low tide, Ned’s not a great one. </p>
	<p>But that’s all behind him now. He’s drawn the line. He tells himself that he’s tired of lining up along the bar with all the other puffy-eyed rummies, like a seal waiting for his trainer to throw him a mackerel. He’s tired of listening to the same bullshit every night, from the same bullshitters, night after night, until the booze fogs his brain and erases everything so it all sounds new the next day. He’s tired of flirting with the same cracked, chipped floozies who haunt every local dive from Sweetie’s to Specs. He’s tired of waking up, mostly in his own bed but occasionally not, wondering what became of those hours after midnight. Who would he be apologizing to this time? Who had he insulted now? Would she be offended or would she laugh it off like it was no big deal, just the artless stumblebumming of another crippled, pathetic alky?</p>
	<p>He’s been drunk more than usual lately, so much so that he no longer wakes up with headaches. Now his hangovers linger as a twitchy hollowness, with fatigue and depression lasting all day. He’s resolved to quit this time, though. He always is, but now he means business. He wants out. He wants his life back. Fuck all this romantic, boho, Bukowski bullshit. For that matter, fuck Bukowski.</p>
	<p>Ned will never be a teetotaler – his liver would probably seize up in the confusion – but he knows he needs to dry out for a spell. Maybe in a month or two he can nurse a glass of wine – after all, the French swill their Bordeaux and live forever – but he’s off the hard stuff for good. No more Scotch. He tells this to his friends and they laugh at him.</p>
	<p>“How do I keep the place open without your support?” Scotty says, cradling a bottle of Johnnie Walker. “You sent two of my kids through college drinking this stuff.”</p>
	<p>“It’s not your getting drunk that gets old,” says Michael Argonne. “It’s your telling us that you’re going to quit drinking and then getting drunk anyway. That gets old. Shit or get off the pot.”</p>
	<p>Ned is determined to shit. Maybe this time he can. The last couple of women he’s been with have been pretty serious barflies. One’s a total lush, actually, a real hard North Beach case, which didn’t help his own sobriety. Now that he’s alone again there’s no reason to go out and get plastered, except from sheer boredom. Ned’s a social drinker. He doesn’t like boozing alone and he never drinks at home. So here’s his chance to stay in at night and clean up a little. If Beerce and Argonne want to drink themselves onto the liver transplant waiting list, fine. He’s done. He’s heard all of Beerce’s war stories anyway, and Michael Argonne has always been a gas bag. It’s not like he’d be missing anything, letting those two go off to the bar without him. </p>
	<p>But it’s hard swimming against the tide of history and Ned’s drinking history is a long one. The road that began with his first vomiting fit at thirteen over a jug of Red Mountain wine cut a ragged and tortuous path through the decades until it reached Tuesday’s hangover. It’s a road strewn with lost loves, broken friendships, and the feeling that life isn’t turning out exactly as he’d hoped. Before landing in the Beach, twice divorced and unemployed, Ned spent years as an occasionally married copy editor. His shifting marital status interfered only slightly with his drinking, and drinking in newspaper bars was playing in the big leagues. He logged thousands of hours in joints like the M&M Tavern, Hanno’s, and Jerry & Johnny’s, South of Market saloons where newshounds flocked to drink, fight, and fuck. That was before the papers joined the Boy Scouts and the gritty neighborhood disappeared, a victim of the tech plague.</p>
	<p>Now that he’s out of the game Ned mostly keeps to North Beach, no slouch when it comes to its own dipsomaniacal history. But it’s different up here. He’s a different drinker here, harder, more focused on the task at hand. His mates are pleasant enough when they’re not too soused, but stimulating conversation can be hard to come by. Ned’s heard everyone’s stories about their screwed up lives, and the loony conspiracy theorists and amateur psychologists bore him to tears. </p>
	<p>He’s a world away from the M&M. You can’t ask a North Beach bartender to place a bet for you on the feature race at Golden Gate Fields, or tell you how tomorrow’s top stories should be played. If you’re lucky, you might find one who keeps dice behind the bar to roll you for a drink. As for the regulars, there’s no Jerry Levinson from Ned’s M&M days, promising to “blow the lid off this town” with his next big scoop. You don’t find women like Stormy O’Brien, either, the longtime crime reporter and self-proclaimed “ballsy dame” who invented her own cocktail at Hanno’s one night. She christened it the Dark and Stormy “and let the bastards sue. Anyway, in my drink you add a shot of rye to the regular rum. Kicks like a mule.” And nowhere in North Beach will you find a character like Pete Corona. Armed with only a pencil, a pica pole, and a dummy pad – this was in the days before pagination – Pete could lay out an entire Sunday sports section from his regular stool at the M&M, downing beer after beer and making everything fit without smearing a line or spilling a drop.</p>
	<p>Ned misses the old days. So it’s time to quit.</p> 
<p id="chapter">*</p>
	<p>He breasts up to the bar. Sexy Sadie is behind the plank tonight. He’s not partial to blondes as a rule but Sadie’s got those big brown eyes and a great shape and, besides, she’s real friendly. She sees him and smiles, and automatically reaches for the Scotch. He waves her off. </p>
	<p>“Not today, Sadie. Just a ginger ale.”</p>
	<p>“Yeah? You stop drinking again?”</p>
	<p>“This time for good. Just a little ice with that, honey.”</p>
	<p>Sadie fills a pint glass and sets it down in front of Ned. She props her elbows on the bar. “For real this time?”</p>
	<p>He sneaks a peek at her cleavage. “Sure, for real.”</p>
	<p>“Well, I’m glad, Ned. I’ve been kind of worried about you, to tell the truth.”</p>
	<p>“Yeah?”</p>
	<p>“Scotty has, too. He says you’ve really been hitting it hard lately. You’re not the type for it, Ned. You’ve got too much on the ball. Not like these other guys here.” Sadie’s silky hair waves with the toss of her head. “I’m glad you’re calling it quits. I’m just as happy pouring you a ginger ale.” She winks at him. “Besides, the Viagra isn’t as potent if you drink too much.”</p>
	<p>“Hey, I don’t need that stuff.”</p>
	<p>“You will, baby,” Sadie says, giving him a big smile as she moves down the bar. “Y’all will, sooner or later.”</p>
	<p>Ned laughs. He downs the ginger ale. He’s feeling good. No … he’s feeling really good. Back in the old days, like the day before yesterday, he’d be ordering another drink now just to keep that feeling going a little longer. But he doesn’t need it anymore. Really. He waves to Sadie, who blows him a kiss, and he heads for the door. He steps out into the cool evening and walks up Columbus Avenue, still so caught up in the elation of taking that first big step that he doesn’t hear his name being called. Then he does, and he looks up.</p>
	<p>“Jesus Christ. Stop the presses.”</p>
	<p>“How the hell are ya, Ned?” Pete Corona is grinning his lopsided grin. He has Andy Kimbrow in tow, another copydesk grunt who spends part of every shift at the M&M. “We’ve been looking all over hell and gone for you.”</p>
	<p>“Ever heard of this thing called a phone?”</p>
	<p>“We called,” Kimbrow says. “Don’t you check your damned messages?”</p>
	<p>Ned pats down his pockets. “I guess it’s at home again.”</p>
	<p>“We’re makin’ the rounds,” Pete says. “We need a third.”</p>
	<p>“How’s your gout?” Ned says.</p>
	<p>Pete laughs. Ned’s missed that insane cackle. </p>
	<p>I’m cornered, he thinks. They’ve got me. He does some quick mental calculations. They’re going to drag me into a bar. Resistance is futile. It’s also rude. I mean, these guys have come up here specifically to dip their beaks with me. It’s the spirit of friendship. It’s what we do. So… So I’ll go. But I won’t touch a drop. I’ll get another ginger ale and recite Billy Sunday’s Wagon speech. Pete will limp to the gents, pass a stone, and come back a changed man. And Andy will throw up his hands in disgust and go home to his wife, sober for a change.</p> 
	<p>They start walking down Columbus. No, not there, Ned says, squirming at the idea of a disapproving Sadie. He steers them across the street, knowing that one dump is as good as another to these mugs. The place is pretty quiet. They line up along the bar with Pete in the middle, like in the old days.</p>
	<p>“What’ll it be? says the bartender. </p>
	<p>“Anchor Steam,” Andy says.</p>
	<p>“Bud Light,” Pete says.</p>
	<p>Ned casts a sidelong glance at his friends and thinks absurdly of the Three Musketeers. Then he looks at the bar back, where the Scotch beckons to him like a forty-dollar hooker. He feels his newly cemented foundation cracking. The wheels upstairs turn again. It’s already Thursday, he reasons, and the week is waning. That’s not necessarily the best time for making dramatic life changes. Not only that, the month is nearly over, too. Monday is the first. That’s the logical time to make a clean start. </p>
	<p>“What about you?” the bartender says. He locks eyes with Ned. </p>
<p>I’m the Rock of Gibraltar. I’m the immovable object defeating the irresistible force. But it’s only a dying impulse.</p>
<p>“Black Label, over,” Ned says, running up the white flag.</p>
