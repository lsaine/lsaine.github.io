<h2 id="title">C'mon Baby, Smile</h2>

	<p>C’mon baby, smile.</p>

	<p>You’re that pretty girl I see walkin’ up the street every morning on her way to work. You know who you are. You’re the girl with that thick blonde hair bouncing halfway down your back and the legs that go from here to there. Whoever cut that skirt you’re wearing sure knew what he was doing, baby, ‘cause you don’t put stems like those inside a pair of dungarees.</p>

	<p>Mmmm-mmm, the good lord painted a masterpiece the day he made you. Every now and then the old man gets one right, yep yep. Those full lips and that heart-shaped face, man alive, you’re the prettiest thing I ever did see.</p>

	<p>So would it kill you to smile?</p>

	<p>When the good lord gave you that body did he give you a heart, too? It would be a shame if he didn’t. It’d be like a sunset with no one to share it with, or a painting without a frame. Somewhere under that fine silk blouse beats the warm heart of genuine kindness. I’m sure about it.</p>

	<p>C’mon baby, smile.</p>

	<p>You’re always in such a hurry when you walk past me in the morning. Where are you going that’s so important you can’t pause for one second to give me a smile as you pass by? Work, right? In one of those cubicles downtown? You call that livin’, baby? Maybe if you didn’t blow your whole paycheck shopping in Maiden Lane you wouldn’t have to go dashing off to the office at the crack of dawn every damned day. Less is more, doll. It’s not like you need any extra anyhow. You’ve got plenty.</p>

<p>C’mon baby, smile. I’m just giving you a little friendly advice.</p>

<p>What is it about a pretty girl, anyway, who can’t spare a smile for a guy who’s a little down on his luck? You think I’ll take it wrong, take it as an invitation? Are you afraid I’ll hit on you if you smile at me? Ask you out on a date, or something? Do I look like I’m crazy? I slept in this doorway last night. I don’t think I could support you in the manner to which you’ve become accustomed. </p>

<p>C’mon baby, smile.</p>

<p>We have this unspoken thing, you and me. It’s like an understanding. Yes we do. And I know you know it, even if you won’t let on that you know. I can tell. I can tell by the way that you deliberately don’t look at me as you walk past. You’re so obviously ignoring me that you’re actually acknowledging our cosmic connection. You can’t ignore someone without being aware that he’s there, can you?</p>

	<p>C’mon baby, smile. </p>

	<p>Some guys I know would call you a Barbie doll, but they’re wrong. They don’t see the things that I see in you. They just see the hair and the lips and the legs. They just see the sex. They don’t see that you’re lonely, or that you spend your weekends walking down the beach with a book of poetry under your arm, or that the slow movement of Mahler’s Fifth makes you cry.  They don’t see your empathy for a world in pain, or that you still miss your mother who died when you were a little girl. They don’t see any of that. But I do.</p>

	<p>C’mon baby, smile. </p>

	<p>Do you have a boyfriend? I know you’re not married because there’s no ring on your finger. But do you have a boyfriend? Please tell me he’s not a stockbroker or a tech bro or one of those guys who knows how to make money but not love. You deserve the best, baby, and it’s a mathematical fact that the depth of a man’s soul shrinks in inverse proportion to the size of his bank account. Like I said before, less is more. </p>

	<p>C’mon baby, smile.</p>

	<p>Oh, baby, there is so much I could give you, so much to tell, so much to share. I’m not asking you to marry me, baby. We don’t even have to speak. But I’ve got a lot to give you, if you’ll just reach out and take it. And all it’ll cost you is a smile.</p>
