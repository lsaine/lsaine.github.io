<h2 id="title">Darrell’s Smokin’ a Fattie With Jesus Now</h2>
<p id="author">&copy; 2016 Anthony Long </p>

	<p>The thing about being old and alone and living in some fleabag SRO in the midst of a big city like San Francisco is that, if you keel over some night, it might take them a while to find you.</p>
	<p>That’s what happened to Darrell.</p>
	<p>The coroner figured Darrell had been dead for maybe a week before somebody got a sickly-sweet whiff of him seeping out from under the door of his room. There were a lot of things that could have killed him, but they finally settled on general organ failure related to his diabetes. Not that it matters. One reason is as good as another for a guy like Darrell. He had high blood pressure, too, and his liver was shot, he was nearly blind from glaucoma, and he had a little cancer. Mainly, though, he was just old. Old and used up. Everyone around the cafe liked him well enough, but we all agreed it was probably for the best, time for him to go. He hadn’t been looking so hot lately, definitely not the old Darrell.</p>
	<p>I think he knew his time was about up. In fact, I’m sure he did. The last time I saw him he said something to me. I didn’t make much of it at the time, but now I think he was telling me he knew he was about to die. He said, “I’m losin’ the funk, man.” That’s all he said and I guess I thought he was just bored or something. Honestly, I don’t know what I thought. Looking back, I wish I’d asked him what the hell he was talking about instead of grinning at him like an idiot. </p>
	<p>Next thing I know, he’s dead. We all felt bad about it down at the cafe. I felt terrible. It’s sad to think of him just lying there, dead and stinking up the joint in his crummy little room and nobody even realizing he’s not around anymore, nobody wondering, hey, where’s Darrell, nobody missing him. Thinking about that depresses me and makes me wonder about myself a little bit. I know he was a very lonely man. </p>
	<p>Darrell landed in North Beach back in the fifties, after coming home from the Korean War. He was a musician, he said, a jazz piano player, although I have to take him at his word on that one. I never saw him play a piano, or anything else, and I knew him for years. But he sounded like a guy who knew a lot about music and he sure talked about it a lot. Of course Darrell liked talking, period.</p>
	<p>He always talked about his wife, too, even though she died a long time ago. He bragged about her like she was still alive. When he wasn’t talking about her, though, he was usually on about that piano of his, and all those classy joints he used to play, and all the famous jazz musicians he jammed with back in the day. He’d sit there at the cafe table, running his long fingers up and down an imaginary keyboard, talking about Bird and Miles and Chet Baker and a lot of other guys I’d never heard of. Whatever he was playing on that keyboard of the mind, he could hear it. I couldn’t hear anything except his fingers drumming on the table but I know he heard every note. Maybe he was making up that stuff, about playing with Miles Davis and all, I don’t know. But if he was living in a dream world, like a lot of people around here tend to do, it sounded like a pretty hip place to be. </p>
	<p>He’d get this dreamy look on his face when he was talking about the old days. His eyes would be half closed, and he’d just lean back and smile … this wide, Cheshire cat smile. He sure sounded like a jazz guy. In Darrell’s vocabulary, guys were cats and chicks were kittens and people didn’t go nuts, they wigged out. He called his piano Ivory and didn’t sound phony doing it. </p>
	<p>Darrell was black, by the way. I don’t think I mentioned that, did I? I wouldn’t bother now except black faces are kind of rare around North Beach. This was pretty much a white neighborhood, Italian mostly, until the Chinese started buying up property back in the sixties and seventies, after the courts made the real estate companies stop red-lining to keep the minorities out. That’s when the Italians sold out and hightailed it for the suburbs. Now there are a lot of Chinese, too, but not that many blacks. And now there’s one less.</p>
	<p>Toward the end there it was obvious Darrell was fading. It wasn’t that he looked like hell because he always looked like hell, like he’d been out all night, every night of his life. But this was different. It was more like he was shrinking, diminishing somehow, getting smaller and fading away, like that other old soldier from Korea. Then he stopped talking, mostly. He’d come into the cafe and sit there not saying anything at all, just staring into space. That wasn’t him at all, not at all. That’s a sure sign of trouble with someone like Darrell, a guy who could bend your ear for hours on end.</p> 
	<p>I’m going to miss him yapping away about his war, you know, the war nobody ever remembers, and all those cool cats he used to jam with. And his wife, who he loved more than anything. His beautiful white wife, Clarice, who none of us actually ever saw, except for a picture that Darrell always carried around in his wallet. Clarice, the woman he married when that kind of thing was frowned upon by polite society. He talked about that, too, and how they were shunned by the North Beach Italians who didn’t approve of race mixing. But he also talked about the how the beatniks, who were also shunned by the North Beach Italians, welcomed them with open arms. Yeah, we used to be such a tolerant town. We were famous for it. </p>
	<p>Darrell and Clarice had a daughter. I forget her name and Darrell never brought her around. But then Clarice got sick and died and the little girl went off to live with relatives somewhere back east. Darrell would go to see her from time to time, in the beginning, then later not at all. I don’t suppose he’d seen her in twenty-five years. I wonder if anybody’s tried contacting her. The VA hospital, probably. They keep records on stuff like that, don’t they?</p>
	<p>Yeah, I guess it was time for Darrell to go, all right. He was so beat down these last years, you couldn’t even call him a relic. I’m sure the young internet kids who haunt the cafe these days thought he was just some old homeless black guy hanging around bumming money for coffee. I mean, Darrell talked pretty fast sometimes and he could be hard to understand, even for those of us who knew him all those years. So I’m sure they thought was just a crazy old bastard muttering to himself and trying to scam a little change. But Darrell wasn’t crazy at all. If you really listened to him when he got revved up, he made perfectly good sense. Good storyteller, too. He was just a lonely old man, that’s all. It made him happy to talk and I’m glad I was one of the people he liked talking to.</p>
	<p>Now that I think about it, maybe one reason Darrell was so hard to understand was that he was always smoking weed, always a little high. He had this old panel truck he kept parked around the neighborhood and he’d just sit there in the driver’s seat, you know, smoking a joint. If you happened to walk by he’d invite you to hop in and share a toke or two. A lot of us did.</p>
	<p>There was some talk around the cafe of doing something for Darrell, maybe holding a little memorial, or a wake, but like most talk around this place it went nowhere. There were only three or four of us who really felt like doing anything and after a while we just gave up and it was pretty much forgotten. Then a few nights ago John Beerce brought it up again. Beerce had been drinking and he was pissed off. He’s a combat vet, too, even though he served after Darrell and fought in a different war, but he felt like he was letting down a brother grunt. He came into the cafe all liquored up, shouting, “He lived, man! He was here! He mattered!” You should have heard him.</p>
	<p>So last night around closing time, Mike brought out his saxophone and a few of us sat around drinking wine and passing a joint while he blew something mellow. A cop car rolled by and the guys inside gave us a wave. Then we walked up to Mike’s place and got stupid drunk. All for Darrell.
