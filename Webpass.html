<h3 id="title">Webpass Receives State Certification </h3>
<p id="author">Lauren Saine, 4.13.2015</p>
  
<p>Local internet service provider Webpass has <a href="http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M151/K164/151164256.PDF">won</a> a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) as a common carrier under California law.  Webpass currently operates in the service territories of AT&T, Verizon, Citizens, and SureWest.   State certification gives the young company the right under <a href= "http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title47/pdf/USCODE-2011-title47-chap5-subchapII-partII-sec251.pdf">federal law </a>to interconnect with incumbent transport owners such as AT&T at reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates.</p>

<p>A California CPCN also makes the company eligible for state subsidy programs, such as the California Advanced Services Fund infrastructure grants and the California Teleconnect Fund (CTF) customer discounts.  Certification opens opportunities to extend their network and to partner with public agencies to serve affordable housing and other public buildings. Competing internet provider Monkeybrains is not certified, so, for example, their small nonprofit business customers cannot take advantage of the CTF 50% discount.</p>

<p> Most importantly for startups, interconnection rights for Webpass will give them more opportunities to interconnect with other networks, thus strengthening and extending their service territory and giving San Francisco startups a new, cheaper, faster option for internet service.</p>
