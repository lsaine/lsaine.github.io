<h2 id="title"> Grab Some Caffeine and Pull Up a Chair </h2>
<br>
<p>While San Francisco's North Beach is no longer the solidly Italian neighborhood it once was, a strong Florentine heartbeat still enlivens its thriving cafe society. Every cafe differs from the next--in clientele and in temperament--and it's been said that the cafe you choose as "yours" says a lot about the kind of North Beacher you are. </p>

<p>The characters in these 13 stories live their lives out of the Caff&eacute; Trieste. They are fictional but the Trieste is very real. It claims to be the oldest coffee house on the West Coast and probably it is. But for its real-life habitu&eacute;s what counts is its warm embrace of the idiosyncratic, the iconoclastic, the square pegs defying the round holes. </p>

<p>As the city around it grows harder and less tolerant, seduced by those old harlots Greed and Avarice, the Caff&eacute; Trieste offers a sanctuary for those wayward souls threatened with extinction by the changing scene. </p>

<p>These are their <em>North Beach Stories.</em></p>
