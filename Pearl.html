<h2 id="title">Pearl</h2>
<p id="author">&copy; 2016 Anthony Long</p>

<p>A hot Saturday night in North Beach and the front door to the Saloon stands open. Her voice drifts out over the neighborhood on the stillness of the air, strong and clear and golden-honeyed.</p>
	<p>The alley outside the bar is crowded, but there is little of the usual slurry milling around. Tonight, even the drunks are respectful in their torpor. This songbird is new, and she demands to be heard.</p>
	<p>Danny Wade, drawn down the hill from the Caffé Trieste, hears something faintly bluesy. He thinks it might be a Joni Mitchell ballad but his knowledge of popular music is, well, limited. Maybe it’s Carole King, or something from that anorexic chick. No matter, what he really wants to see is the possessor of this beautiful instrument.</p>
	<p>A muddy 8-by-10 promotional photo, tacked cockeyed above the “Now Playing” sign outside the Saloon, reveals little besides the photographer’s ineptness with studio lighting. Four scruffy bandsmen with ridiculous haircuts strike affected poses around a slender woman perched serenely on an ottoman. The name under the photograph reads, simply, “Pearl.” It might be the girl; it might be the band. Danny squeezes into the packed bar and inches his way back toward the stage.</p>
	<p>Pearl, if that’s her name, is tall and striking in the spotlight. She’s also young. Too young, Danny reflects in a moment of hopeless speculation. But she’s not too young to be a pro. Her voice could easily overwhelm this packed, sweaty room but Danny can see her in control of herself, throttling back on pitch and volume before letting go at the peak, the workmanlike musicians struggling – and failing – to match either her strength or dusky subtlety. She’s a headline singer shackled to a Cotati jug band. </p>
	<p>Pearl holds the sweltering room. From the stage she towers above the crush of boozy, swaying humanity, coolly bringing the song to its close. Danny watches her moving gracefully inside that long, green dress; she betrays none of the awkwardness given to the tall. Pearl, a thick coil of chestnut hair trailing behind her, seems to float above the crowd.</p>
	<p>Regal, Danny thinks.</p>
	<p>The song ends and the set is over. The Saloon roars, hoots, stomps its approval. Pearl introduces the band, calling out each musician by name – Dave, the ham-fisted drummer; Trevor, who could be wielding a baseball bat as easily as a guitar; the keyboardist, Steve, who seems to missing a couple of fingers off his right hand; and Mario, the dour, pouty-lipped bassist – favoring each one with a dazzling smile he doesn’t deserve. Pearl, young, poised, and talented, can afford to be generous. A hundred roads will open to her. Working the lower depths now, at the beginning, but with a future assured. How old is she? Twenty-two? Twenty-five, tops.</p>
	<p>Danny considers his own odyssey of a half-century plus, and the pieces of his life scattered at his feet like so much broken porcelain, his roads closing down one by one, and decides to call it a night. He ducks into the gents and is passing the bar on his way out when a whirl of green flashes in the corner of his eye.</p>
	<p>“Leaving already?”</p>
	<p>Danny turns to face Pearl. She <i>is</i> tall. He looks up into her soulful brown eyes.</p>
	<p>“It’s late,” he says. “I’ve got an early day tomorrow.”</p>
	<p>“You should hang around,” Pearl says, ignoring his weak ad-lib. “We’re doing another set. I’ll be doing my own songs.”</p>
	<p>“I like your voice.”</p>
	<p>The dazzling smile again. “Thanks. I could tell you were into it. By the way you were watching.”</p>
	<p>“Yeah?” Pearl has caught him off-guard. Danny’s usually pretty slick with the wordplay. Right now, though, he can feel his knuckles dragging along the floor.</p>
	<p>“It was different from everyone else.” Pearl swipes a rebellious strand of hair from her face. “You were really listening.”</p>
	<p>“I’m sober. Anyway, I only heard part of one song.”</p>
	<p>“Maybe,” she says. “But I noticed you.”</p>
	<p>Danny orders Scotch and sticks around for the last set. Her music is quirky, the lyrics dark and introspective. Nobody’s dancing anymore and the place slowly clears out. Pearl doesn’t seem to notice, or care. She’s way beyond these rummies, Danny thinks. Afterward, they have coffee at a Columbus Avenue cafe that’s open late. </p>
	<p>“I’m not in the habit of leaving bars with strange men,” Pearl says. “It’s a bad way to meet guys – decent ones, anyway. Some of the dumps I play need swineherds more than bouncers.”</p>
	<p>“I’ve had my shots,” Danny replies. “Most of them, anyway.” Pearl laughs.</p>
	<p>“You’re different. And you’re not a complete stranger. I’ve seen you at the Trieste before. Several times. You’ve never noticed me, I guess.”
	<p>“That’s hard to believe.”</p>
	<p>Then it occurs to him that he has, in fact, seen her before. Standing in the coffee line. Still tall at eight in the morning, but with her hair pinned up, no makeup, hiding behind thick reading glasses and wearing sweats and running shoes. Gets her latté in a to-go cup, even though she takes it to a back table with her laptop.</p>
	<p>“You must live in the neighborhood.”</p>
	<p>Danny nods. “On Green, just above Kearny. Rent controlled, thank god. What about you?”</p>
	<p>“I’ve got a studio on Varennes. Also rent controlled. So we’re practically neighbors.”</p>
	<p>“Well, as long as we’re neighbors,” he says brightly, “let’s be friends.”</p>
	<p>She squeezes his arm, which Danny finds exciting. And a bit unnerving. </p>
	<p>They chat. </p>
	<p>She’s from L.A., a refugee from one of those airless, sunburnt cul-de-sacs out in the Valley. She legged it to San Francisco the day after her high school graduation, on the run from a miserable childhood. Her life until then had been littered with stock characters from a Tennessee Williams play: a dysfunctional, alcoholic mother and an abusive father topped the bill, while pleading, demanding boyfriends and inadequate teachers played their supporting roles. She’s been singing since she was little, partly as a way of hanging on to her sanity. For Pearl, San Francisco represents the City on the Hill that the rest of America claims to be but never was. There’s more freedom up here, she says, a better vibe. It’s been nearly six years now and she’s never gone back south, not even for a short visit, not even for the funeral when her old man’s heart suddenly quit on him. When you’ve been fending for yourself as long as I have, you know how to draw a line and move on, she tells him.</p>
	<p>Danny should be paying closer attention to this part of Pearl’s story. Instead, he hears himself asking her to dinner sometime, and he hears her saying yes. When he wakes up Sunday morning, he finds a phone number scrawled on the back of an envelope in his jacket pocket. So he hadn’t dreamed it. </p>
	<p>It takes him a few days to call. He needs time to screw up his courage, time to let his imagination run wild. He thinks about his last girlfriend, Kathryn, a lot closer to him in the ravages of age, and wonders what she’d make of him strutting around North Beach with this stunner on his arm. He can hear her voice now, sneering and injured: “Who’s the <i>arm</i> candy, Danny?” He wonders, too, why Pearl accepted his invitation. What could someone like that possibly see in a fifty-five-year-old unemployed hack writer with two ex-wives, a personal bankruptcy, and a tattoo-covered kid who plays guitar in some smarmy garage band down on Shotwell Street? There’s also the twenty extra pounds he’s carrying from a steady diet of ice cream and Scotch, and a left Achilles tendon that’s ready to snap. Who can explain attraction? Maybe she sees him as a song to be written. When he finally does call, Danny’s heart is in his throat. In a matter of a few days he has succeeded in raising the stakes from a casual dinner in the neighborhood to a little cottage in the woods and pony rides for the kids. Withering looks from his ex-wives, from Kathryn, from an assortment of discarded girlfriends haunt him as he punches in the number.</p>
	<p>“Tomorrow night? I’m sorry, Danny, I can’t.” Pearl offers no explanation. His crushed silence reaches her through the phone so she elaborates. “I’ve got a gig over in Oakland.”</p>
	<p>“Oh,” he says lifelessly. “Okay.” Unexpectedly rebuffed and not the nimblest bloke when caught off guard, he lets things lapse into another awkward silence that spreads like a stain. </p>
	<p>“Umm, we could make it Sunday night,” Pearl says after an age.</p>
	<p>“We could, yeah,” he shoots back a little too eagerly. He’s all studied nonchalance on the follow-up. “Well, ahh, what time Sunday works for you?”</p>
	<p>They meet at Sodini’s for some cheap pasta and <i>vin ordinaire.</i> Pearl wears green again, this time a flowing, crushed-velvet number that flatters both her height, nearly six feet, and complexion, luminously white. Over the dress is a bodice in leafy, autumnal colors, giving her what Danny drolly calls her Eleanor of Aquitaine look. She surprises him, and completely disarms him, by actually knowing who Eleanor of Aquitaine was. Pearl’s hair cascades over her shoulders, crinkling a little where it frames her high cheekbones and wide smile. He likes her slight overbite and finds her beautiful in a singular way, pleasingly flawed, not airbrushed to impossible perfection like one of those cartoon girls in the glossies. As for Danny, he’s the epitome of eighties chic: His graying hair is longish and artfully unkempt, and he wears a battered Harris tweed over a chambray work shirt, his jeans faded and his sneakers well worn. He remembers too late that Pearl has only the dimmest recollection of the eighties, and the late eighties at that. He feels underdressed and, strangely, overmatched. It’s a feeling he’ll come to know well.</p>
	<p>The Oakland gig went badly, Pearl says. Steve, the keyboardist, didn’t show up and improvisation is not the band’s forte. The club owner docked them Steve’s modest cut and made it clear he didn’t want them back. Pearl admits her voice wasn’t all it could have been, either.</p>
	<p>“I can’t imagine you ever sounding anything less than wonderful,” Danny offers gallantly. He fancies it a nice opening move. Pearl accepts the compliment with a shrug. Her riposte stands him on his head. </p>
	<p>“I really like you, Danny. A lot. And I trust you. Instinctively. I don’t trust men very easily.”</p>
	<p>He nods dumbly.</p>
	<p>“Like I said, I’ve noticed you at the cafe. I like the way you laugh with your friends. You have an honest face.” She winks at him. “And you’re cute.”</p>
	<p>“I’m fifty-five,” he says helplessly.</p>
	<p>Pearl laughs. “And I’m twenty-three.” She looks at him frankly. “Why don’t you get to know me better before deciding whether or not that makes a difference.”</p>
	<p>“It doesn’t,” he says, hurling caution to the wind.</p>
	<p>“Well, you asked me out, so I didn’t think it would. And I accepted, so you can draw your own conclusions from that.”</p>
	<p>Danny’s in free fall. Pearl’s youth and vitality come with a maturity and self-assurance as unnerving as it is intoxicating. Twenty minutes into their first date and Danny knows he’s ceding control of this thing to Pearl. He knows that’s a mistake. He also thinks he might fall in love with her. He knows that’s a mistake, too. He tries shaking off such a crazy idea but the ground is already rushing up to meet him. </p>
	<p>They talk about Pearl’s music, and her hopes for it. When Danny worries that her songs might be too darkly sophisticated to land on anybody’s Top 40 list, she shrugs again. “I write what I feel,” she says. Material success as a goal bores her. It’s the music that matters. “I’m sure you feel the same way as a writer.” At the moment, Danny isn’t sure that he does. In truth, he could use a little material success just now. But she’s scanning him with those soulful brown eyes, searching for a glimmer, some sign that he shares her artistic sensibilities. So he goes with it, smiling and nodding, and without too much prompting resurrects the plot of a moribund first novel, forgotten pages moldering in the bottom of his file cabinet. For a while he’s the incandescent wunderkind of his youthful fantasies, pumping new life into a manuscript he hasn’t looked at for years. Along the way he imagines a couple of new characters and even concocts a satisfying ending, something that eluded him all the way through his discarded first and only draft. </p>
	<p>Pearl seems completely absorbed, urging him on, challenging some of his more implausible plot twists, even offering a few suggestions of her own. Her insights impress him and her fluency is music to Danny’s ears. When he’s done, she refills their wine glasses and they toast the muses. The clincher comes when Pearl casually claims Dorothy Parker as one of her inspirations. Danny is floored. “My mother was her doppelganger,” he tells her. “I didn’t know anyone your age even knew who Dorothy Parker was. Who <i>are</i> you?” She laughs brightly when he suggests that Pearl Before Swine might be a good name for her band. He’s hooked. It was that easy.</p>
	<p>Over coffee, Danny takes her hand. She accepts it with another dazzling smile.</p>
	<p>“Feel that?” she says, squeezing. All he feels is the faint stirring of an erection. “Feel the energy? We have a connection. You don’t get that very often. It’s rare.”</p>
	<p>Danny leans across the table and kisses her. “I’m going to fall hard for you.”</p>
	<p>“Good.”</p>
	
<p id="chapter">*</p>

	<p>“Watch out for her, man,” John Beerce tells Danny one morning at the cafe. “She’s kryptonite in a miniskirt.”</p>
	<p>Michael Argonne peers over his reading glasses and nods in agreement. “It’s not like you to go chasing after a cuntling, Danny. And now you’re telling us you’re in love with her? After what? Three weeks? She’s twenty-<i>three</i>, for crissake. Where do you think you’re going with that?”
	<p>“Age doesn’t matter.” Danny says this like a guy who’s pretty sure that age does matter. “We’re happy.” He seems less sure about that. He doesn’t have to add, “And I’m scared.” Anyone can see that. </p>
	<p>“Yeah, you’re happy all right,” Beerce says. “Until she dumps you. And she will. Count on it.”</p>
	<p>“Another poor sap falls to the Mount of Venus,” Michael Argonne says. “More guys have died climbing that mountain than any other mountain on earth.”</p>
	<p>Beerce cackles while Danny glares at them. “Since when are you clowns such experts on women? You don’t even know her.”</p>
	<p>“I don’t have to <i>know</i> her, man,” Beerce says. “Yeah, she uses a lot of big words but don’t let her fool you. She’s a kid. She won’t even know herself for another five years, if then. Emotionally that girl is just passing through. She’ll chew you up and spit you out on her way to someone else. Mark my words.”</p>
	<p>Michael Argonne grins. “You might say she’s an uncultured Pearl.”</p>
	<p>“Wise up,” Beerce says. “You know what you should tell her? ‘You’re way too young to be lookin’ at me like that, honey. Now go and do your homework.’ That’s what you should tell her.”</p>
	<p>“Yeah? Well you guys can piss off.”</p>
	<p>“Anything you say, Danny boy,” Beerce says, shaking his head. “But don’t worry. We’ll be here to swab the blood off the deck when that girl cuts your heart out.”</p>

<p id="chapter">*</p>

	<p>May turns into October. It’s been a good summer, by and large.</p> 
	<p>They made love that first night and Danny performed heroically, unaided by modern chemistry. In that sliver of time he was twenty-five again, a raging stallion. But time is the great equalizer and as things settled down he began making discreet visits to the local pharmacy. Pearl, meanwhile, had no trouble adjusting her thermostat to match Danny’s variable temperature.</p>
	<p>They found common ground elsewhere, too. Beyond the pleasures of the flesh were the pleasures of living in a city teeming with so many distractions that to be bored was to be dead. Before Pearl, Danny felt dead. Now he was alive again. Alarmingly so, sometimes.</p>
	<p>That’s probably where the first pangs of fear came from, an acknowledgement that he suddenly had something to lose. As he predicted, he’d fallen hard for Pearl. And even though his ardor was returned with the same intensity, at least at first, he could never quite shake the feeling that she was holding out on him, denying him that last little piece of herself that, in his overheated imagination, would turn two into one.</p> 
	<p>To prove himself, to convince her of his love – in reality, to bribe her into wanting to stay – Danny showered her with fancy dinners and elaborate nights on the town, nights that drained his modest bank account and ran up ruinous charges on his credit cards. She accepted these gifts and enjoyed them and played her role. If Danny wanted his five-star meal served with a femme fatale on his arm, she gave him one. If he plied her with champagne at the Opera House bar, she’d polish off two during intermission and be ready for a nightcap after the fat lady sang. On casual evenings at home with a pizza and a movie, she cuddled with the best of them. She always showed up with her dazzling smile, her easy banter, and her undivided attention.</p>
	<p>And yet.</p>	
	<br></br>
	<p>Uncertainty festers like a sore. Danny hears footsteps, and not only in his sleep. If they go more than a few days without seeing each other he starts imagining things, none of it good. Even when they’re together he’s easily spooked. He does his best to hide it but the cracks show. When a curly-haired waiter half his age flirts with Pearl he shows a grin as hard as cement and stiffs the kid on the tip. These are uncharted waters for Danny. Beautiful women have filed through his life before – he married two of them, didn’t he? – but they generally hailed from the same decade. Shopping for a gift, he thinks back to where he was in life the day Pearl was born: seven years into his first marriage, hired twice and fired once, holder of “I Voted” buttons from four presidential elections, a rebuilt shoulder from a motorcycle accident, and a waist size that expanded from a 29 to a 33 in five short years. What he’d give to be a 33 now.</p>
	<p>And Pearl? She does her best to reassure him. It would surprise him to know that she actually does adore him. Everything she does underscores the point but Danny’s too self-absorbed at the moment to notice. His insecurity bothers her, and is beginning to irritate her, but she isn’t baggage-free herself. She’s scared, too. Pearl is experienced for a woman her age, but she’s never known anyone like Danny before. Previous lovers checked their emotions at the door as they trooped past. They didn’t overstay their welcome. They were mostly older men, too, and Pearl was their vindication, but they left when it was time to go. Then Danny shows up with his emotions laid bare, dropping them on the table and kicking off his boots, with no intention of leaving. She’s having a tough time handling that. She’s more comfortable feeling desired than feeling loved.</p> 
	<p>Now it’s late Indian summer and Pearl concedes to herself that a crisis is brewing. Her perspective of Danny is changing, almost imperceptibly, day by day. In the beginning he excited her imagination and she couldn’t wait to be with him. He was loving her in a way she’d never been loved before and she found herself responding. He was writing again, and making plans. They talked about traveling together. He was fun. Now, here in October, he still loves her but his grinding insecurity is leeching his spirit. And hers. It takes more energy to rouse herself when they meet. She still thinks he’s wonderful, someone worth loving, but that isn’t enough. Her desire, on every level, is waning. </p>
	<p>They’re together one night, quiet in the afterglow. That’s when Pearl chooses to lean in close and whisper, “Baby, I need more space.”</p>
	<p>“Space?”</p>
	<p>“I need it, baby. I’m not used to being with anybody like this. Not this much.”</p>
	<p>“But I love you.” Danny hears the neediness in his voice and hates it.</p>
	<p>“I love you, too,” she says, rising to her elbows. “But I need more space.” A lone candle provides the only illumination in the room. Her eyes glow like liquid pools in the candlelight as she looks down at him. “I’m feeling suffocated.” She strokes his hair.</p>
	<p>“Suffocated? How am I suffocating you?”</p>
	<p>“We’re together constantly.”</p>
	<p>“Two or three times a week? That’s constantly?”</p>
	<p>“I need more space.” She falls back on the bed and lies silently beside him.</p>
	<p>Danny searches for logic against the pit in his stomach. “But people in love are together. That’s normal. I’m in love with you. I want to make a life with you.”</p>
	<p>The sheets rustle like cellophane and he feels a sudden chill in the room. “What do you mean,” Pearl says slowly, “make a life with me?”</p>
	<p>“I… I, well, I want … you know. To make a life. To be together. To live together. I don’t know.”</p>
	<p>“We’re not going to live together.” For the first time he feels her harden. “You’ve got your own life, separate from mine. Live it. Let’s enjoy what we have right now. Let’s just live in the moment.”</p>
	<p>Danny can’t speak. He’s sown the wind with his reckless falling in love. Now, sooner than imagined, he’ll reap the whirlwind. He stares at the shadows dancing on the ceiling, and sighs. Pearl nudges him gently. “Be here now.”</p>
	<p>“Kiss the joy as it flies,” Danny says morosely. He feels his throat tighten.</p>
	<p>“What?”</p>
	<p>“It’s from Blake, I think.” He pauses, as much to collect himself as to consider his accuracy. “I knew a guy once who taped that line to his typewriter. ‘Kiss the joy as it flies.’ Essentially, live in the moment.”</p>
	<p>“Well, Blake was right.”</p>
	<p>As Danny remembers it, Blake’s own views on love were pretty ambiguous, making him a dangerous man to invite into this discussion. </p>
	<p>“Look,” he says. “I love you. I want to be with you forever. I don’t see what’s wrong with trying to make that happen.”</p>
	<p>Even in the flickering candlelight, the incredulity on Pearl’s face makes a stark mask. “Forever? Do you know what ‘forever’ is for me? A few months, maybe.” She leans over him and strokes his cheek with the back of her hand. “I don’t see an end for us yet, but don’t talk to me about forever. I never stay anywhere for very long.”</p>
	<p>“You’re only twenty-three. You haven’t been with that many men, period.”</p>
	<p>Pearl is silent.</p>
	<p>“Very few, anyway.”</p>
	<p>Silence.</p>
	<p>“Have you?”</p>
	<p>“It doesn’t matter how many men I’ve been with.” Her voice is harsh. “And don’t go pulling the age card on me. I don’t appreciate it.”</p>
	<p>Defeated, Danny offers a final, plaintive bleat. “I just want to love you.”</p>
	<p>“Love me, then. Just don’t suffocate me, okay?” Pearl kisses him on the forehead, as a mother would kiss a child. “Remember <i>Of Mice and Men</i>? Remember Lennie and the rabbit?” She pantomimes a throttling motion. “I make a lousy rabbit, baby. G’night.”</p>
	<p>She blows out the candle.</p>
	<br></br>

	<p>That night marks their point of departure. They’re still together but Danny’s running scared now and Pearl grows increasingly, and more obviously, frustrated. The weeks pass. They continue walking into swanky restaurants that Danny can’t afford, and they still cuddle in front of the TV. The love is still there. But there’s desperation to the whole thing now, quiet on her part, palpable on his. They’re killing themselves from the inside out.</p>
	<p>It’s a Thursday night and they’ve been downtown. Now they’re at Pearl’s place. She slips out of her clothes and into a nightdress. They sit facing each other on the bed. She takes Danny’s hands in hers.</p>
	<p>“I just want to say that I’ve never been so happy in my life,” she tells him. “No one has ever been so good to me. I want you to know that I appreciate it and that I’ll always love you.”</p>
	<p>Something’s coming. He feels his face growing hot. Mechanically, he replies, “I’ll always love you, too, baby.”</p>
	<p>“I love you so much, in fact, that I’d like you to consider the possibility of making this an open relationship.” She squeezes his hands while giving him the most earnest look he’s ever seen.</p>
	<p>Several heartbeats go by.</p>
	<p>A select few know how it feels to be hit squarely between the eyes with a two-by-four. Danny comes pretty close now. It’s a clean shot that leaves him spinning. His brain fogs. In those few nanoseconds when the frontal lobe is running way ahead of the reality outside the body, all of his fears coalesce around the lurid picture of Pearl in the arms of some gleaming, rutting Adonis. It’s not the first time he’s tortured himself with this image but now it’s real, a hologram that clangs around inside his head like a hammer in a clothes dryer. His thoughts are fragmented, broken pieces from the underlying fear now shattered by reality: I’m too old for her, she’s too young for me, she wants to screw other guys, I’m too old…. On and on it goes, an endless loop.</p>
	<p>Then, like a late San Francisco morning, the fog slowly lifts and Pearl gradually comes into focus. Danny’s aware that she’s still holding his hands and he realizes that he’s been staring at her the entire time. He straightens up and clears his throat. Pearl sits serenely, her gaze soft and expectant.</p>
	<p>“Is there somebody else?” is the best he can manage, and in a clotted voice.</p>
	<p>“No.” She squeezes his hands again. “That’s not the point.” Wasting no time, she comes to the point. She’s not monogamous, she says. Never has been, never will be. She began this affair with no expectations beyond having a little fun and getting to know someone she found attractive. Until now, the possibility of a future with this man, or any man, has never crossed her mind. But now, Danny, you’ve come along and messed things up.</p>
	<p>“We’re having our ups and downs,” she says, “but I love you and I want to stay with you.”</p>
	<p>But it changes nothing. She’s not monogamous. For his sake she’s kept her mouth shut and stayed on the straight and narrow, but the clock is ticking. It’s been seven months and she can no longer deny who she is. Not only can’t she deny it, she won’t.</p>
	<p>“I’m bringing this up now because I can actually see a future with you. I’d like us to have that future, in fact. But there have to be some … refinements.”</p>
	<p>“Refinements.” Danny smiles despite himself. “To account for your non-monogamous nature.”</p>
	<p>Exactly. Pearl will be traveling a lot in the coming years as her singing career takes off. She’s paid her dues and now it’s time to soar. She’ll leave her crummy band behind, leave this quaint but limited town behind. She’ll leave this man behind, too, if they can’t resolve things. She doesn’t want to, but she will. It’s time to be practical. In the course of things, other men are bound to enter the picture.</p>
	<p>“Besides, I’m only twenty-three, remember.”</p>
	<p>“Now who’s playing the age card?”</p>
	<p>She ignores the remark. Instead she lays out the scenario for their future. Her love is unconditional and her loyalty will be unswerving. Just because she might occasionally feel the need to, in her words, let someone else in, Danny shouldn’t feel threatened. And it’s a two-way street, she reminds him: he can “do some exploring” of his own. </p>
	<p>“Being open will only strengthen us,” Pearl promises Danny, whose unhappy thoughts turn briefly to the poet Blake. “Nothing will ever diminish my love for you. No one will ever come between us, you can be sure of that.”</p>
	<p>Danny can’t be sure of that, or of anything else. He’s wounded and confused. If nothing will ever come between them, why the buffer? Is this layer of emotional insulation really necessary? What secret terrors will these nameless lovers shield her from? Isn’t polyamory – Pearl has to define the word for Danny, who has never heard it before – just an excuse for avoiding real intimacy? Or is Pearl simply a randy young woman needing a little variety in her sex life?</p>
	<p>He’d be angry if he could – he wants to be – but he simply doesn’t understand. So he sits there, lumpen, letting Pearl expound on the virtues of open living. He hears her, but he’s no longer listening.</p>
	<!--<p>No doubt there are people in the world who can swallow their jealousy and their fears, and maybe some pride, too, and not dissolve into a puddle when their lover spends the occasional evening in someone else’s arms. It’s plain to Danny, however, that he’s not one of them. He’s too much the idealist to handle that kind of emotional detachment. It’s a matter of loyalty – his kind, not hers – and for him a floating libido is incompatible with his image of a happy couple, even with everything open and above board. Maybe his sensibilities are more catholic than he’d care to admit. His young girlfriend, it seems, is cut from very different cloth.</p>-->
	<p>Sensing his drift, Pearl makes her final pitch.</p>
	<p>“Think of us as a hit song, baby. The singer performs that song, night after night. In the beginning, when it’s new, she glows in the spotlight. Then audiences start to expect it, then they demand it, and they sit through her entire show just to hear <i>that one song</i>. She starts feeling trapped. She’s being stifled artistically, and she begins to resent the song. If it goes on too long she may even come to hate it.</p>
	<p>“You’re a beautiful song with some lovely lyrics, Danny, and I’ll never tire of singing that song. But I can’t be limited to a single tune.”
	<p>Even as the pain engulfs him, he has to appreciate the metaphor.</p>
	<p>He raises his palms in a gesture of surrender.</p>
	<p>“Let me think about this for a while,” he says, rising to leave. He already knows how things will turn out but he’s too raw to confront that now. Pearl knows, too. She walks him to the door. They hold each other for a long time.</p> 
	<p>A few days go by, then a week. He misses her, misses her voice, misses walking with her and holding her hand. He misses their closeness and their whispers. Several times, when the aching won’t subside, he almost calls, but in the end he doesn’t make the move. There’s no point. She’ll never be able to give him what he wants and he’ll never be able to give her what she needs. There’s nothing left to say. He remains silent. So does she. They keep an awkward distance.</p>

	<p>At the cafe, John Beerce and Michael Argonne haul out the mops and bucket.</p>
	<p>“You gotta remember,” Michael Argonne says, “she’s still young. She’s got the looks and she’s going to use them. You think you’re going to have her all to yourself? Christ, man, she’s practically made for doing the wondrous naughty. She’s cock candy, Danny. She knows it, if you don’t.”</p>
	<p>Danny stares at his folded hands.</p>
	<p>“Okay, you drank your fill, so lucky you. Now give thanks to the god you don’t believe in and move on.”</p>
	<p>Danny looks up, shaking his head.</p>
	<p>“You think she’s young? Let me clue you, Mike, she was never young. In some ways she’s older than you or I will ever be.”</p>
	<p>“Were you monogamous when you were twenty-three?”</p>
	<p>“I was married when I was twenty-three.”</p>
	<p>Beerce grins. “That’s not what he asked you.”</p>
	<p>“Okay,” Danny says. “She’s Holly Golightly.”</p>
	<p>“Forget all that,” Beerce says. “Face it man, you were outgunned. You had no chance. None. Holly Golightly, my ass. You were rolling around with young Lady Macbeth. She had her finger on the trigger the whole time. When she’d had enough she pulled it and it was bye-bye Danny. You can’t say you weren’t warned.”</p>
	<p>“That’s not fair, John. She’d have stuck around if I ...”</p>
	<p>“Let her whore around? That’s the way it goes, right?” Beerce leans back in his chair, self-satisfied, his fingers laced behind his head. “The sweet ones bore you. The woman you really want is the one who’s totally messed up, or says she has to be free, or isn’t ready for anything real. The one who’s crazy. That makes you want her even more.” He shakes his head. “We’re the most fucked up mammals around, man.”</p>
	<p>“You guys,” Danny says, moving to the door, “have been a big help.”</p>
<p id="chapter">*</p>
	<p>Hoping to distract himself, Danny goes back to his novel. He works on the new ending, the one he’d concocted for Pearl that first night at Sodini’s. In the end though, he quits. This thing needs more than a new ending. It’s garbage. He burns the manuscript so he’ll never be tempted to waste that much time on anything so futile again.</p>
	<p>Somewhere he hears that Pearl has started seeing someone else. Some gargoyle even older than he is.</p> 
	<p>It’s a Saturday night in North Beach, a chilly one this time, and Pearl is playing another gig at the Saloon. Up the hill at the Caffé Trieste, Danny Wade nurses his cheap red wine and cocks his head as if straining to hear a sound. He stares, unseeing, out the window. Then he turns away and buries his nose a little deeper into someone else’s cheesy novel. </p>
