<h2 id="title">From Room 323 at the Sam Wong Hotel</h2>
<p id="author">&copy; 2016 Anthony Long</p>

<p>"I'd like a room with a clear view down Jack Kerouac Alley."
	<p>Patchen Denny smiles at the pretty Chinese desk clerk. She does not smile back. Expressionless  -- yes, even inscrutable -- she stares him down to the point of rudeness before turning to her computer to consult a floor plan for the Sam Wong Hotel.</p>
	<p>"Room 323," she finally says. She looks at her computer again. "It has two queen-sized beds."</p>
	<p>Denny fumbles through the ritual of checking in, bemused by her lack of curiosity. After all, here's this guy, his clothes disheveled, his hair flyaway, with only a small backpack for luggage, not minding the extra cost for two beds, specifically requesting an unobstructed view down the alley, and according to the register he lives only four blocks away. All that, and her carefully penciled eyebrow doesn't stir. For all she knows he could be a professional sniper. The Jackal and Lee Harvey Oswald rolled into one. Or he could be a hound, waiting for his best friend's wife to show up.</p>
	<p>Or he could be a slightly obsessive, discarded husband getting ready to do a little spying on the ex-wife and her new boyfriend. </p>
	<p>Room 323 is unremarkable in the way that mid-priced hotel rooms always are. The decor is low-end Kowloon: a framed silkscreen print hangs above the bed, featuring a stork or some kind of large bird emerging from a pond; there's a pair of lacquered nightstands with a matching tallboy dresser, and a Ming-style coffee table encased in ersatz cherry wood. A golden dragon uncoils itself in the stitch work of the black bedspread. </p>
	<p>Denny does not feel transported to the exotic East. The real action will be right here, outside on the street.</p>
	<p>He places a chair in front of the window and pulls back the curtain. He lets his eye wander all the way down Jack Kerouac Alley, past the paper Chinese lanterns and iron balconies. Dusk is falling and the first drunk has already staggered out of Vesuvio's and vomited into the brickwork of the street. Columbus Avenue is its usual Friday night stampede of testosterone-fuelled cars. But across Columbus, maybe two hundred feet from Denny's vantage point in the Sam Wong Hotel, is the stub end of Adler Place, the alley where Specs is. That's his object of interest tonight. That's his target. He fishes a pair of field glasses from his backpack, along with a bottle of Glenlivet, and sets them on a small table near the window. Then he settles in to wait.</p>
	<p>Denny feels like a spy in a le Carr&eacute; novel. Hardly a cheery prospect, considering how most of le Carr&eacute;
's spies end up: cuckolded, dead, or out in the cold. Two out of three, he thinks, and treats himself to a rueful smile. </p>
	<p>Belle is dating someone new. He hasn't seen the guy yet but reports have filtered in from his eyes and ears around North Beach. A lawyer of all things, someone said. "From charm to smarm," John Beerce had told him, trying to rally his friend. "Probably an ambulance chaser."</p>
	<p>"Not Belle's type," Ned Forrest had put in, patting Denny on the shoulder. "I see a glorified accountant who manages the affairs of trust-fund babies."</p>
	<p>Whatever he is, Belle apparently approves. She walked out on Denny on the afternoon of her fortieth birthday, mere hours before the surprise party he was throwing for her was to begin. Now, barely six weeks later, she's dating some lawyer called Kent.</p>
	<p>Kent.</p>
	<p>Ned made the first sighting, spotting them together at the Caff&eacute; Trieste. It was the first time Belle had turned up at the cafe since giving Denny the heave-ho. Her first time back in weeks and she's got this Kent guy in tow, a clear violation of territorial decencies if ever there was one, Ned would say later. She introduced him to a few people, the ones she could count on to be friendly or neutral. She didn't introduce him to Ned and avoided making eye contact after they sat down a few tables away. But her voice carried, like it always did, and Ned heard them planning a night out. On Friday. This Friday.</p>
	<p>Patchen Denny knew exactly what that meant, which is why he's cooling his heels tonight in Room 323 of the Sam Wong Hotel.</p>
	<p>That night out will end as all the others had ended when he and Belle were together. It will end with a nightcap at Specs, the bar where he had met her, courted her, and won her. </p>
	<p>The light is fading outside. Denny glances at the clock radio: 7:37 on a crisp summer's evening. Belle and Kent are probably just sitting down to dinner at some fancy-schmancy restaurant where she can indulge in dress-up games and he can flaunt his bankroll. </p>
	<p>Two months ago he couldn't have imaged her sitting down to dinner with anyone but him. Clearly he didn't know her anymore. Had he ever known her? Had she and Kent been having an affair all along? Were they now making the rounds of all the places he had taken her over the years, tete a tete over cocktails while she tells him, "I knew this boy once..."?</p>

	<p>It's still shy of eight o'clock. They won't be at Specs much before ten. Denny finds a paper-wrapped water glass in the bathroom, rummages for ice, and fixes himself a whisky. He turns on the TV to help kill time. The Giants are in Los Angeles to play the Dodgers. He turns the sound down and watches the players loping across a silent screen. The Giants pushed across a run in the top of the first but the Dodgers have the bases loaded with one out in the bottom half and Matt Cain is wild. Outside, a couple of guys begin arguing in Kerouac Alley. Denny looks out the window as the swearing grows louder but things simmer down when one of them flips the bird and walks away. When he looks back at the TV the Dodgers have gone ahead 3-1. As the Giants' pitching coach comes out to settle Cain down, Denny wonders what he'll do when Belle and Kent turn up at Specs. From here he can do nothing but peer at them through his binoculars. It would be a fleeting glance at best, lasting as long as it takes them to get from their cab to the front door of the bar. </p>
	<p>Then what?</p>
	<p>Would he just sit here, wallowing in self-pity while they finish their drinks, hoping to catch another glimpse of Kent the lawyer before they vanish into the night? What about Belle? There had been a few e-mails and a couple of strained phone conversations while they tried, as she put, to settle things. But he hadn't laid eyes on her since the day she left. Once he sees her he knows he'll be unlikely to look away. What dress will she be wearing? Will it be one of the ones she wore for him or something new? Will her hair be up or down? Denny prefers it up, for the elegance. Will she be wearing any of the native jewelry he'd bought for her while sailing up and down the Mexican coast? Or has Kent already showered her with costly baubles from Shreve's?</p>
	<p>Denny makes it even odds that if he stays in his room he might not notice Kent at all. </p>

	<p>He hasn't thought this out very well. Maybe he can be forgiven this logistical lapse, seeing as how he's been pretty rocky since Belle left, but a hundred-and-fifty-nine bucks is a lot of money to blow on maybe ten seconds of eyeballing the new boyfriend and finding new ways to feel pain. Maybe the best thing to do is to watch them go into Specs and then confront them there. Patchen Denny isn't combative by nature - he's named for a poet, for god's sake - but he remembers Ned telling him that if he wants to get Belle back he'll have to fight for her. "The alpha approach will work on a girl like her," Ned had told him.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, Denny hasn't seen Kent yet. He might be pretty big. It would be a sorry night indeed if he not only made a fool of himself in Specs but got his ass kicked in the bargain. He must have thought about this for a while because when he looks at the TV again the Giants have tied the score. The clock radio says 9:04. He props himself against the headboard of the bed nearest the window and stares, unseeing, at the screen.</p>
	
<p>An old Chinese guy hawking up a lunger in the street below snaps Denny from his reverie. It's 9:43. The score is still tied with the Giants batting in the eighth. Denny picks up his binoculars and moves to the window. There's a good crowd outside of Specs, milling in the alley, so the bar itself is probably packed to the gunnels. It's mostly the bridge-and-tunnel yokels on a Friday night but Denny recognizes a few faces, people who will certainly notice Belle walking in with her new fancy man. She must really like this guy, he thinks, to be taking him into Specs. His throat is dry. His palms are moist. He feels a fluttering in his gut. </p>
	
	<p>They'd had their moments, like any married couple, but Belle hadn't been unhappy. She always seemed okay. Their careers - Belle was a freelance magazine writer while Denny enjoyed a tenured perch in San Francisco State's English department - meant a fair amount of time spent apart, but it wasn't a problem. They had made a nice life together, entertained well, taken nice vacations. There were no children but Belle never said she wanted any. Nor had she ever claimed to be unhappy. Not once. Live with someone for twelve years, two months, three weeks, and a day and you'd think you'd know if something was rotten in the state of matrimony. You'd think there'd be a few hints, a sign or two. </p>

	<p>Denny remembers something. Once, back in the beginning, on a cold, moonless night while they lay together in the sweaty aftermath, Belle had asked him to describe his perfect fantasy lover. It took some prodding before he stopped saying "You" and delivered, in monotone, a predictable, puerile, masturbatory image ripped straight from the pages of <i>Penthouse</i> magazine. "Your turn," he said, not enjoying this game at all.</p>
	<p>She looked at him square with her gray-green eyes and replied, "A blue-collar guy with a library card."</p>
	<p>That was all she said. Then she tucked her head into his shoulder and fell asleep, leaving him to stare at the ceiling for a while.</p>
	<p>Denny, the pampered son of university professors, could supply the library card but had never lifted anything heavier than a laptop. In the Denny family one didn't sweat, one perspired - and then only on the squash court or playing the back nine on a muggy afternoon. Or perhaps, as in the case of Professor Norman Denny, while holding forth in bed with one of his promising, alluring proteges. Young Patchen could wade through the labyrinth of Spinozan ethics and deconstruct Mailer, but he couldn't fix a broken toilet seat or change a flat tire. </p>
	<p>"A blue-collar guy with a library card." </p>
	<p>With those eight words, Denny turned on a metaphorical dime. He gradually replaced tweed with denim, grew his hair a little shaggier, and started working out. Within the year he'd bought a motorcycle, then spent some time eying a friend's boat before buying that, too. </p>
	
<p>It was a real scow, a twenty-one-foot sloop that, fixed up, made a nice little day sailer. While he'd grown up around boats, he was nobody's idea of a wharf rat. Belle seemed impressed, though, which was all that mattered. She didn't need to know that he'd learned his handling skills from yachtsmen, not rovers. With a nod to Jack London he christened his boat <i>Snark</i> and learned her quirks from stem to stern, worked on her till she gleamed. He tied her up at the Ramp down south of the Bay Bridge, even though there were berths available closer to North Beach. He told Belle that he did it for the convenience of hauling out, since the Ramp was the only yard in San Francisco to provide the service. And that was the real point: the Ramp was more boatyard than marina and therefore carried the stamp of the blue-collar sailor. </p>

<p>He taught Belle to sail. After a few years he sold <i>Snark</i> and traded up to a bigger boat that he called <i>Mizzen Belle</i>. He kept that one parked at the Ramp, too. Together they sailed the bay. They sailed the coast. One summer, after Belle had determined her seasickness was transitory, they even sailed to Hawaii. Then, gradually, she stopped going out and Denny finally rigged <i>Mizzen Belle</i> for solo sailing. When he asked her why she quit, Belle said that she'd lost her sea legs, that she simply wasn't the sailor her husband was. "Well, I'll be gobsmacked," he replied, doing a little Popeye hornpipe, and Belle laughed and he laughed and that was the end of it. She never complained about him being out too long. She never said that she was unhappy. But she never went sailing again, either. </p>

<p>Mostly, Denny sailed alone. If he wanted company he'd use beer to lure one of his cafe buddies aboard, or invite a few of his favorite students to join him, leaving Belle to fill in the time. He'd feel guilty because even though she was working he wanted to be with her. They still took a big vacation every year but now they flew there: Paris, Mexico City, Bali. When State closed for its long summer break, Denny took to sailing alone down the coast. The first couple of years he made the easy passage to Catalina but eventually he began extending himself, putting in at La Jolla, then Ensenada, then Cabo. One year, toward the end, when an involved assignment kept Belle on the road herself, Denny took <i>Mizzen Belle</i> all the way to the Sea of Cortez. He called her from a noisy bar in Guaymas. She sounded a long way off. But she sounded happy to hear from him.</p> 
<p>In the end, though, she scuttled him.</p>

<p>In Room 323 of the Sam Wong Hotel, he tries to remember what she said the day she left, the day she was supposed to be surprised at her fortieth birthday party. Instead, she surprised him and it happened so quickly that he has trouble recalling the specifics. "I can't take this anymore," sticks in his head. It was a throwaway line that she'd tossed over her shoulder as she walked out the door, carrying a small suitcase. Dumbstruck, he'd just watched her go, watched her get into a waiting taxi that she'd managed to call without him knowing. She never explained what it was that she couldn't take anymore. She didn't say on the two occasions they'd spoken over the phone. He was owed an explanation. Her e-mail had provided information - the name of her attorney, where her clothes could be sent - but no reasons why. He aches for a reason why.</p>

<p>A cab pulls up in front of the alley. Denny's heart jumps as a couple steps into the street but they turn up the hill and disappear into the neighboring hipster bar. Besides, the woman is a blonde. Or, at any rate, not a brunette. Denny looks at the clock. 9:55. The game is still on but he doesn't check the score. He massages his aching temples and turns back to the street. He doesn't have long to wait. When it happens, it happens fast. 

<p>He recognizes Belle instantly. She's wearing her hair up tonight, held in place with the tortoiseshell clip he'd found on his voyage to the Sea of Cortez. She's wrapped in that familiar long coat of hers, too, the one she inevitably wears both as protection against the night air and to conceal her outfit until it's time to display herself. She's got her gold heels on tonight, which means she must be wearing that gold dress with the plunging neckline. Her arm is linked with a graying, slightly jowly man with blunt features. He's wearing horned-rimmed glasses, a pleasant look, and what Denny takes to be some kind of sharkskin suit over a black turtleneck. Lawyer clothes. He's not a blue-collar man, that's for sure, and he isn't especially big. I can take him, Denny thinks.</p> 

<p>They stop in the alley outside of Specs while Belle chats with one of the street musicians she knows. She's smiling and looking happy. Kent is smiling, too, shaking hands. Denny finds himself wondering if Kent touches her in the ways he had. When he strokes her in bed, does he linger at that little hollow above her hip? Does he massage the nape of her neck, then let his fingers trail along her spine, raising the hairs? Does she like Kent's touch as much as she once liked his? Peering at her through the glasses, he guesses that she does.</p>

<p>The Scotch that he's been sipping all night courses through his veins. There's murder in Denny's heart. </p>

<p>Then they're gone, disappeared into the bar. Denny falls back on the bed, his eyes wet and his head pounding. Six weeks? Is that all it takes to rebuild a life? Six weeks? He feels sick from the Scotch, and from everything else. The room is spinning as he writhes in the sheets. He buries his face in the pillow. </p>

<p>Belle's back is to the door when Denny shoulders his way into the crowd but Kent's eyes round in surprise. Somewhere he must have seen a photograph. Denny can smell Kent's fear. He lurches forward a few stools and stops, maybe fifteen feet away. Kent straightens, his eyes remaining locked on Denny. Belle, her back still turned, keeps right on talking. Kent throws Denny a beseeching look, one not without sympathy. Not here, he seems to be saying. I'll explain everything, but not here.... Not now.</p>

<p>Denny throws up and spins out of the bar. </p>

<p>Or does he? </p>
<p>He wakes up in Room 323 of the Sam Wong Hotel. The sheets are soaked. He doesn't remember either leaving or returning to the room, but Kent's expression couldn't have been a dream. Denny can still see the alarm on Kent's face. He needs it to not be a dream. His mouth is bone dry. He reaches for the bottle, which is two-thirds empty. Screw this. He pours the remainder of the whisky into the toilet and takes a long drink of water out of the bathroom sink. Then he packs up his stuff and leaves.</p>

<p>Glancing at the clock above the front desk - it's just past two a.m. - he notices the pretty Chinese desk clerk still sitting there. She looks up from her magazine.</p>

<p>"Is everything all right, Mr. Denny?"</p>
<p>"Everything's fine, thanks." He drops the room key on the desk.</p>
<p>"Are you unwell?"</p>
<p>"No," Denny says. "Not unwell."</p>
<p>"Then have a pleasant evening, Mr. Denny," she says, returning to her magazine.</p>
<p>Denny nods, walks slowly out of the Sam Wong Hotel, and goes home.</p>
<p>The next morning at the Caff&eacute; Trieste he picks up a discarded sports section. The Giants beat the Dodgers in 11 innings, 4-3, on a home run by Buster Posey. </p>
