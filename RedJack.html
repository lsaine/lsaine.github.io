<h2 id="title">Red Jack</h2>
<p id="author">&copy; 2016 Anthony Long</p>

<p>It’s the first day of May – May Day – and Maud is coming to visit.</p> 
	<p>For this happy occasion, Jack Macklavore casts aside his faded dungarees, his khaki work shirt, and his steel-toed boots. He ambles into the cafe wearing a rumpled dress shirt that was once white, a threadbare sports coat that was once handsome, and a pair of serviceable slacks, only lightly stained. His loafers threaten to split along the seams but are holding together, thanks to some artfully applied electrical tape. He’s even taken a stab at combing his hair.</p> 
	<p>Ever present, of course, is the tiny red star with its gold hammer-and-sickle inlay, a resolute beacon winking from his lapel.</p> 
	<p>“You look like a three-martini banker after four martinis and a stock market crash,” Ned Forrest says. “That is, if Brother Marx had been a banker.” Macklavore’s face lights up and his basso laughter rumbles across the tabletops.</p> 
	<p>“I don’t recall Marx saying anything about turning up badly dressed for the revolution, do you, comrade?”</p> 
	<p>Ned laughs. “When’s Maud getting in?”</p> 
	<p>“Any time now.” Macklavore grins ear to ear, wringing his hands. “Her plane landed a little while ago.”</p> 
	<p>“You get her a May Day present?”</p> 
	<p>“Always, Ned. Always.”</p> 
<p id="chapter">*</p> 
	<p>The spirit of the ’34 waterfront strike is long gone in this town but that doesn’t stop Jack Macklavore from agitating for its return. From his customary roost at the back of the Caffé Trieste, Macklavore spreads those enormous, calloused hands, his workingman’s hands, flat on the table, draws himself nose to nose with whichever moist-eyed web surfer happens to be crowding his table space, and stage whispers:</p> 
	<p>“Organize.”</p> 
	<p>It isn’t much of a pickup line. These kids have no idea who this prune-faced codger is, with his flowing white hair and tobacco-stained moustache, his broken nose, his rotted teeth. Sharp black eyes dart like a fanatic’s and he grins like a crazy man. He gives most of them the heebie-jeebies. They certainly don’t know what he means by the word, delivered with a coal-scuttle Glasgow burr that makes him sound like an alzheimered Sean Connery. Organize? Organize what? My iTunes library?</p> 
	<p>But it breaks the ice. </p> 
	<p>Even sitting down Macklavore is big, big in a way that men aren’t big any more. The breadth of his shoulders and the depth of his chest he came by the hard way, not chiseling away in a gym and preening in front of a mirror, but through the backbreaking work of toting and lifting and hoisting from the holds of great ships tied up dockside from the Firth of Tay to San Francisco Bay.</p> 
	<p>Macklavore hasn’t been a working stevedore in decades yet he remains, on the cusp of eighty, an unbowed oak of a disappearing breed. His sheer size and surprising vitality make him appear more menacing than he is, so most of his would-be disciples instinctively draw away, or move to another table, or simply get up and leave the cafe. Every now and then, though, one chooses to stay put and Macklavore searches for a flicker of interest crossing an otherwise vacuous face. If he finds it, he leans in conspiratorially and says, “Let me tell you about Howard Sperry and Nick Bordoise, then.”</p> 
	<p>Today, awaiting Maud’s arrival, he finds himself staring across the table at a delicate-looking young man with a closely cropped, ginger-colored beard. He’s nursing a decaf latté, caressing his little phone as if it were a woman. Their eyes meet when the boy looks up and he smiles shyly when Macklavore exhorts him to “Organize!”</p> 
	<p>The boy nods uncertainly. I’ll have some fun with this one, Macklavore thinks.</p> 
	<p>“Got time for a story, laddie?”</p> 
	<p>There’s another tentative nod.</p> 
	<p>“What’s your name, then?”</p> 
	<p>“Jake.”</p> 
	<p>“Jake. That’s a fine name. Strong. Known some Jakes in my time. All of ‘em jake. Get it?” He reaches across the table. “Jake, meet Jack,” and the boy’s slim hand disappears into Macklavore’s enormous paw.</p> 
	<p>“I don’t mean to be takin’ you away from whatever you’re doing with that piece of plastic there, but would Jake like to hear the tale of two great martyrs? Two heroes – real heroes, not the Fox News kind – whose sacrifice helped build a better life for working men and women in this country?”</p> 
	<p>Jake shrugs. That’s good enough for Macklavore.</p> 
	<p>“Well, then…. In 1934, when I was wetting my diapers in Dundee and your own dear mother wasn’t yet a gleam in her own dear father’s eye, San Francisco was the greatest seaport on the entire Pacific Coast, from the Bering Strait to Cape Horn…”</p> 
	<p>But Jake’s eye has fallen on Macklavore’s lapel pin. Rude without meaning to be, he blurts, “Are you a communist?”</p> 
	<p>The clatter and hum of the cafe
	
	 deepens the silence around Macklavore, who glares at him from under snowy, untrimmed eyebrows. “Why?” he finally says. “Are you from the FBI?”</p> 
	<p>Jake emits a simpering laugh and Macklavore, playing him like a trout, is careful to laugh with him. “Watch out, lad. Thirty-odd years of right-wing class warfare is making my kind relevant again. We’ll be hiding under your beds before you can say ‘Save us, Ronny Reagan.’ Now … may I continue?” Jake blushes.</p> 
	<p>So with the artful swoop of a natural storyteller, Macklavore takes young Jake back to the city’s waterfront of eighty years ago and tosses him unceremoniously into a shape-up. </p> 
	<p>“You’re a longshoreman and you’re desperate for work. So are all the other hungry men milling around outside the gates at Pier 32 on this dreary morning. Join the mob and pray, brother. With luck you might get work one day out of four, depending on the overseer’s whim. If you’ve slipped him a little something on the sly, or staked him to a drink or two recently, maybe he’ll find you in the crowd. Then again, maybe he won’t. You’ve got a wife and kids to feed, but the boss man doesn’t care. All he sees are men reduced to begging for work, and he’s got his pick of the litter. You with me so far?”</p> 
	<p>“Mmm-mm.”</p> 
	<p>“By the way, Jake, what do you do for a living?”</p> 
	<p>“I work for Twitter.”</p> 
	<p>“Pardon me?”</p> 
	<p>“I’m in social media.”</p> 
	<p>“I see,” says Macklavore, who clearly doesn’t. “Well, at least you’re working.”</p> 
	<p>The shape-up, he explains, is a humiliation, the equivalent of throwing meat scraps to a pack of starving dogs. Along with the elaborate system of bribery and kickbacks, the shape-up is meant to pit the dockworkers against each other, to keep them divided and cowed, to banish union militancy from the waterfront. </p> 
	<p>“The gang boss might look you square in the eye and hold it for an extra beat or two, just to make sure you know he’s looking at you, before calling out the name of the man standing behind you. If you’re an ILA man, or don’t belong to the company-run blue book union, good luck getting work. Still with me, are you Jake?”</p> 
	<p>“Sure. Were you a longshoreman?”</p> 
	<p>“Indeed I was, laddie. Not back then, obviously, but later. And if my life was better it’s because of the tough battles and the hard sacrifices that were made then. And because of Saint Harry.”</p> 
	<p>Jake, suddenly dull of eye and slack of jaw, shrugs.</p> 
	<p>“You’ve never heard of Harry Bridges, then.”</p> 
	<p>“Uh-uh.”</p> 
	<p>“I thought all this internet rigmarole was supposed to make you kids so smart. Don’t they teach history in school anymore?”</p> 
	<p>“I’m smart,” Jake says defensively, adjusting his designer glasses. “I know about history.”</p> 
	<p>“You know what the system wants you to know. You know the mythology. But you don’t know the truth. If you did you’d be wearing one these pins yourself.”</p> 
	<p>“I doubt it.”</p> 
	<p>Macklavore ignores the provocation. “And the system would just as soon you forget all about Harry Bridges.”</p> 
	<p>“So who was this guy, then?”</p> 
	<p>Just for a moment Macklavore pictures his enormous hands wringing Jake’s pencil neck. Just for a moment. Then the moment passes.</p> 
	<p>“For your information, boy-o, Bridges was one of the greatest labor leaders in this country’s history, maybe the greatest. Whatever princely sum, whatever benefits you receive from that social … job of yours, it would be a hell of a lot less if not for the likes of Harry Bridges. Sure, he was a leader of the big waterfront strike and, sure, he set up the ILWU, my union. The International Longshoremen and Warehousemen Union. But his influence went way beyond the docks. He was a titan, old Harry was. He was a champion of the working class. That big plaza in front of the Ferry Building? That’s Harry Bridges Plaza, although you’d never know it. Not a plaque or a statue or a bust to be seen. It’s a scandal.”</p> 
	<p>“Oh.”</p> 
	<p>Having figuratively wrestled young Jake into a pair of denim coveralls and stevedore’s cloth cap, Macklavore leads him through the heavy pier gates and marches him up the ship’s gangway, straight into one of the cavernous cargo holds. </p> 
	<p>“The pay is terrible and the work is dirty and dangerous, especially with the bosses pushing you to go faster – a speed-up, in labor terms. Those pricks would rather work you to death than pay a dime more. A palette loaded with pig iron or bundled rebar can wreak havoc if something goes wrong. Hell, a sack of coffee beans or a load of animal hides can flatten a man. Some of the boys ended up as useless cripples and more than a few got killed. Do you think the shipping owners took a care for the widows and orphans?”</p> 
	<p>Jake shakes his head as if he’d never understand such wickedness.</p> 
	<p>“No. Well, by 1934 the fellas had had enough. Almost    everyone had, what with the Depression and whatnot. People were having trouble just keeping a roof over their heads. But even then the capitalists stayed rich, as the capitalists always do.”</p> 
	<p>“Capitalism built this country,” Jake blurts, recalling some childhood catechism. </p> 
	<p>“Mythology, Jake. You’ve been conditioned to believe the lie, that’s all. Drank it in with mother’s milk, you did. Now listen: <i>Labor</i> built this country. The capitalists exploited that labor and took the cream for themselves. Still do. Leave you with the dregs. Your sweat, their profit.”</p> 
	<p>“You <i>are</i> a communist.” </p> 
	<p>“Let’s not quibble over ideology.”</p> 
	<p>“Then you lost. Communism lost, and capitalism won.” Jake is triumphant.</p> 
	<p>The kid is getting under Macklavore’s skin. He just wants to finish his story but Jake’s smug look pisses him off.</p>  
	<p>“Did it? Did it now? If it did it was a pyrrhic victory. Look around. Look at your country, laddie. Is that what victory looks like? Capital won a reprieve, that’s all. And what was defeated when the Soviet Union collapsed? It wasn’t communism. It wasn’t even very good socialism. It was state-run capitalism, that’s all. It failed and it’s gone. This free-market bullshit will be buried, too. It’s already choking on its own greed. So what comes next? That’s anybody’s guess but unless fascism rises again – and for your sake I hope it doesn’t – the smart money is on some kind of socialism. I won’t live to see it, but you might. Lucky boy.”</p> 
	<p>Jake’s forward lean suggests a boxer in a clinch, of a gathering outburst, of a pending counterattack. But he merely folds his arms on the table and remains silent. His expression relaxes into pasty-faced neutrality. Surrender? Indifference? Insolence? Whatever it is, Macklavore has lost interest in him. No point in wasting more time with this little fucker. Wrap it up. Besides, Maud’s due any minute.</p> 
	<p>So he edits ruthlessly, turning his novel into a short story. All the complications and contradictions leading up to that fateful Bloody Thursday in July 1934 are stripped away. He ticks off the grievances that finally caused the longshoremen to strike and he lauds Harry Bridges again as the man who gave them the guts to walk. Provocatively, he tosses a bouquet to the Communist Party for its role as a driving force, not only behind the coastwise strike but the entire American labor movement <i>and</i> the New Deal. (“That’s right, laddie, your forty-hour work week, your paid vacation, your Social Security all come wrapped in a red flag – not the stars and stripes.”) He hammers home the ship owners’ arrogant intransigence, the treachery of the scabs, and the police brutality, which the strikers repaid in kind. </p> 
	<p>He’s quick about it, maybe too quick. The narrative comes off like a PowerPoint summary, if only Macklavore knew what PowerPoint was. Jake is drifting and Macklavore sees the boy’s wandering eye straying to his smartphone.</p>  
	<p>“Howard Sperry and Nick Bordoise were murdered!”</p> 
	<p>Macklavore pounds the table and Jake, startled, is attentive once more. </p> 
<p>“It was murder, pure and simple. The goons shot them in the back, both of them. But it changed everything.”</p> 
<p>If that was Jake’s cue to ask how it changed everything, he misses it. Macklavore plows on.</p> 
<p>“A hundred other men were wounded, but it was the deaths of Sperry and Bordoise that turned the people completely in favor of the strikers. A general strike shut down this city for four days. When it was over, labor had won a great victory. It lit a fire under industrial unionism everywhere. San Francisco became a great union town. And so it remained, until that bastard Reagan came along and burned down the house. May he be turning on a spit in hell.”</p> 
<p>Jake isn’t inclined to argue. In fact, he’s packing up.</p> 
<p>“The point, Jake, is that unions provide leverage against the bosses. They protect you from exploitation on the job. Stand alone and you’re nothing. Stand united and you can’t be defeated. So: Organize.”</p> 
<p>Rising to leave, Jake isn’t much taller than Macklavore is sitting down, but he can’t resist a last word.</p> 
<p>“Thanks for the history lesson, Jack, but none of this is relevant now. This is the information age. We live in a meritocracy. We rely on our own talents to get ahead. People don’t need unions anymore.”</p> 
<p>“In God and capital we trust, eh?”</p> 
<p>Jake smiles and flexes his scrawny bicep in a “We Can Do It” pose on his way out the door.</p> 
<p>Macklavore looks at Ned, who’s hiding behind a book a couple of tables away.</p> 
<p>“Where in the hell <i>is</i> Maud, anyway?”</p> 
<p id="chapter">*</p> 
<p>His good mood fouled, Macklavore retreats to throw some cold water on his face. Today is May Day, though, and here’s Maud, unfolding herself from a taxi and striding through the front door of the cafe like a really big dame looking for a fight. She’s into her mid-thirties now, grown into her mother’s prettiness, and even though she’s square-built like her father she’s nicely proportioned. She drops her bags at an empty table and has just given Ned Forrest a hug when she spots the old man coming out of the gents. She lets out a happy yelp and gives Ned an excited punch, while Macklavore, beaming, mumbles some old commie endearment in Russian. They embrace, like a couple of grizzly bears, in the middle of the cafe. </p> 

<p>Macklavore steers her to a table. Here’s the doting father, kissing her forehead. After fussing her into the most comfortable chair he goes to the counter and orders her favorite tea. Ned, absent-mindedly rubbing his arm, watches them from a few tables away. Maud is still daddy’s little girl, even if she looks like she could suit up at linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers. </p> 

<p>Despite their age difference Ned is Macklavore’s oldest friend at the cafe and he remembers, too vividly sometimes, the long night when Maud was born. Meg was also much younger than her husband but it had been a difficult pregnancy. Now there were complications. Macklavore wanted to be in the delivery room to help Meg pull through but the doctors nixed it. So he called Ned, who came to the hospital and sat with him under the fluorescent lights in a dreary waiting room littered with maternity pamphlets and celebrity-gossip rags. After an eternity, someone came out and told Macklavore that he was the father of a healthy girl. And a widower.</p> 

<p>In his grief it took him two days to name the baby. The hospital refused to release Baby Macklavore without a full name on the birth certificate. Between crying jags Macklavore wracked his brain, trying to remember what Meg wanted to call a daughter, before finally giving up and deciding to honor his own mother. And he added a flourish of his own: Maud Red Rosa Macklavore.</p> 

<p>“Ned!” Macklavore’s voice booms across the cafe. “Doesn’t Maud look fantastic!”</p> 
<p>In fact, she does look fantastic. Ned has never seen her looking better. He’s certainly never seen her dolled up like this. The flowing hippie dress is gone, so are the Birkenstocks. She’s wearing a stylish city suit cut to flatter her plus-size curves, dark stockings over shaved legs, and a fine pair of patent-leather heels. Then there’s the makeup, subtly applied, but a first for Maud. Gone, too, is the French braid that once ran down her back like a piece of dark, coiled rope. Her hair is smartly done up and if Ned isn’t mistaken, tinted to boot.</p> 
<p>As Ned and Maud exchange glances, he catches a glimpse of Macklavore hovering over her. The old man is seeing her, really seeing her, for the first time. His face is a mask frozen into a smile emptied of joy. His stricken eyes are fixed on Ned, beseeching him, as if to say, Tell me, friend, what the hell is going on here? What have they done to my little girl?</p> 
<p>“She looks like a million bucks, Jack,” Ned says. He almost says “like a million rubles,” to tease a chuckle out of Macklavore, but no. Maud’s makeover was definitely paid for in Yankee dollars. She accepts Ned’s compliment with a thin smile and rests her head against her father’s outstretched hand.</p> 
<p>The cafe is in a momentary lull, which deepens the awkward silence in this corner. Ned picks up the sports section from a discarded newspaper and pretends to scan headlines that he’s already seen and forgotten twice this morning. Then, without looking up, he hears Macklavore rally.</p> 
<p>“You’ve changed your hair.” There’s another pause. “It’s very becoming.”</p> 
<p>Leaving the cafe, Ned frowns at Maud’s furrowed brow. As he leans over to kiss her on the cheek, he whispers, “You look great, sweetie. Let him down gently.”</p> 
<p>On every visit home since moving east, Maud has made a ritual out of taking her father to dinner on her first night in town, always to Tommaso’s, one of the last old-guard Italian joints left over from “their” North Beach. Tonight will be no different, except that it will be very different indeed.</p>  
<p>To please him, and to lessen the blow, Maud goes native. She scrubs off her makeup and slips into one of her flowing skirts. Colored beads replace the princess-style necklace she’d been wearing earlier. There isn’t much she can do with her hair, though, as most of it wound up on the gleaming floor of a posh Upper East Side salon. To compensate, she wears an old beret, <i>a la</i> Che. If only Tom could see me now, she thinks while adjusting the beret in a mirror. </p> 
<p>Alessandro greets them as family when they arrive at Tommaso’s, leading them down the stairs to a booth in the back, past a crowd of impatient, idling diners waiting for their tables. And after all, they <i>are</i> family. Macklavore began taking Maud to Tommaso’s when the place was still called Lupo’s and Maud was the biggest little girl anyone had ever seen. Wine appears instantly and is followed in short order by an antipasto plate, salad, and some piping hot garlic bread. The pizza, Alessandro assures them as he swings back to the kitchen, will be along in a jiffy. They never cracked a menu.
Macklavore wills himself to smile across the table. He raises his glass.</p> 
<p>“You look very lovely tonight, Mouse,” he says as they toast, reviving her childhood nickname. “New York has changed you, though. I knew it would, if you stayed long enough.”</p> 
<p>“Daddy…”</p> 
<p>It’s an old wound. Macklavore never wanted Maud to go to New York in the first place. What, he argued, would a master’s from NYU give her that a BA from Berkeley couldn’t? It was a feeble argument and he knew it, and it was beside the point. The real problem was that New York was 3,000 miles away and he didn’t want to lose the most precious thing in his life. The closest he came to admitting this to her was when he said, not long before she left, “It will be lonely here without you.” She went anyway but Macklavore never knew how close his pathetic lament came to derailing her plans. Because Maud adored him and adores him still.</p> 
<p>“Daddy…”</p> 
<p>You should have stayed here. You could have been a university adjunct here just as easily, or landed a good job with the local ILWU administration. I could have fixed it. At the very least you should have come home after getting your master’s. I’m selfish, I admit, but I’ve needed you all these years. Two visits a year isn’t enough, it just isn’t enough. Not for all the love I have for you. You’re my daughter, my only child, and let’s be realistic: time is short. You’re also my only link to Meg and Christ knows I still miss her every day. You’ve been in New York for more than ten years now. And look at you. See how that meat grinder has changed you.
<p>“Daddy…”</p> 
<p>Remember our little place on Filbert Street? You could hear the dryers turning in the laundromat downstairs. You had the bedroom and I slept on the couch. You learned to play the guitar in that apartment. I taught you to sing the “Internationale” there. In English and Russian. You’d sing for the comrades when they came over for our political evenings. Those were the days, weren’t they? Singing and swearing and solving the earthly problems of our miserable species. We were together when the Cold War ended in our kitchen, remember? The Wall came down on that drizzly November afternoon while I was brewing coffee and you sliced the cake. We all agreed that this would be a new beginning for socialism. It hasn’t worked out that way. Not yet. But it will. Meanwhile, I’m living in a single room and you’ve gone off to New York, into the belly of the beast.</p> 
<p>“<i>Daddy!</i> Are you listening to me? Have you heard a single word I’ve said?”</p> 
<p>Macklavore wipes his greasy chin with a napkin and delicately burps up some garlic bread. “You’re shouting into my bad ear, Mouse. Anyway, I’m getting senile.”</p> 
<p>“That’s your good ear and I’m not shouting. And don’t kid yourself. You’re still the sharpest knife in the drawer.” You’ll need those wits now, she thinks, to handle what’s coming.</p> 
<p>The pizza arrives. A little more chin grease, a little more belching, and another generous pour of Chianti: now, Maud decides, is the time. Macklavore is wrapping up the story of his morning wrangle with young Jake.</p> 
<p>“Short-arse thanks me for the history lesson and flounces out of there like he owns the joint. Insolent swine. But he’ll get his. They all will, eventually.”</p> 
<p>“He sounds awful. I’m sure he’s a spoiled brat. So many are these days. But,” she takes a deep breath, “but not <i>all</i> of them.”</p> 
<p>“Well, no, I’m sure not all of them.” Her shifting tone breezes past Macklavore like a subtle change in the weather. He looks up from his pizza. <p>“Wait. What do you mean … not all of them?”</p> 
<p>Maud raises her glass and contemplates a piece of cork floating in the wine, measuring her next words. </p> 
<p>“Mouse?”</p> 
<p>She fishes the cork out of the wine with a carefully manicured nail and looks across the table at her father, truly one of the wretched of the earth. Arise, she thinks. Then, after taking a long pull on her wine she says, simply, “Daddy, I’m engaged.”</p> 
<p>“Engaged?” She hears his voice crack, or imagines she does. He’s immobile. “Engaged? To be married?”</p> 
<p>Maud nods, resolved to muscle her way through, but she crumbles under Macklavore’s stricken gaze and the words tumble out as a plea. “He’s a wonderful man, Daddy. He’s the best man I’ve ever known, truly. He loves me and he asked me to marry him and I said yes.”</p> 
<p>Macklavore’s eyes narrow like someone straining to hear, like an old man disoriented at a crossroad. She wants to come around the table and hold him, to tell him that everything will be all right, but she finds herself frozen in place. Then, slowly, she watches his face soften and she takes his hand when he reaches across the table. She’s too far away to kiss on the forehead so Macklavore pats her on the cheek. For the first time, she notices a certain feebleness in her father. </p> 
<p>“<i>Khorosho</i>,” he says, using the Russian. Good. “<i>Ochin khorosho</i>.” Very good. And he applauds in that little clapping way the Russians do to show their appreciation. He fills both their glasses with more wine and proposes a toast. “Long life and much happiness,” he says, again in Russian. “<i>Nostrovia</i>.” <p>He drinks deeply and sits back in his chair. “So, Mouse,” in English this time, “tell me about this lad of yours.” </p> 
<p>“His name is Tom.”</p> 
<p>“Tom.”</p> 
<p>“Yes. Well, Thomas. But he goes by Tom. I mean, everybody calls him that. I do, anyway. Tom.”
<p>Macklavore ponders the implications. “And what is he like, this Thomas-who-goes-by-Tom?”</p> 
<p>“Well, he played football at Holy Cross.”</p> 
<p>“A strapping Catholic lad, then.”</p> 
<p>“I don’t know if he’s Catholic, Daddy. He’s never said. If he is, it isn’t very important to him. He doesn’t go to church or anything like that. Besides, I don’t think you have to be Catholic to go to Holy Cross.”</p> 
<p>“They’re Jesuits, I believe.”</p> 
<p>“I, I … don’t know what they are.”</p> 
<p>“What else?”</p> 
<p>“Hmm?”</p> 
<p>“What else can you tell me about your young man?”</p> 
<p>“Well … he was born on Christmas eve.”</p> 
<p>“He’s sounding more Catholic all the time.” Macklavore says this kindly. “Did you know that in Russia they believe that someone born on December 24th is liable to turn into a werewolf? Did you know that?”</p> 
<p>Maud manages a weak giggle. “Tom is no werewolf, Daddy.”</p> 
<p>“Well, then, tell me this. What does your Thomas-who-goes-by-Tom do for a living? Is he in the Party?”</p> 
<p>Maud sags visibly. She mumbles something.</p> 
<p>“I didn’t quite catch that, Mouse. What did you say?”</p> 
<p>“No, he’s not in the Party. He … works on the Street.” She picks up her wine glass and looks hard for another piece of cork.</p> 
<p>“On the street? What is he, then? A paver of roads? That seems an odd thing to do with a diploma from a fancy New England Jesuit college.”</p> 
<p>“No, Daddy, he doesn’t pave roads. He works on Wall Street.”</p> 
<p>Macklavore freezes like a prisoner caught in a searchlight. He stares across the dimly lit cellar, his only movement an involuntary backhanded pass across his moustache. When Alessandro drops by to ask if they want dessert, it’s Maud who says they’re done and asks to pack up the leftovers. <p>Macklavore doesn’t seem to notice when she lays an American Express card, a gold one, on the table. After an age, he says, “I don’t suppose that Thomas-who-goes-by-Tom is a janitor, is he?”</p> 
<p>“No, Daddy. He isn’t.”</p> 
<p>“I see.” There’s another long pause before he fixes her with a cold gaze. “Yes, I do see.” His voice is ominously subdued. “It appears your Tom is a werewolf, after all.”</p> 
<p>She saw this coming. From their first meeting in that Greenwich Village cafe, from that first little tremor that told her that Tom was not only different, but right, she knew there would be a reckoning if things went too far. Jack Macklavore is a loving father, maybe the most loving of them all, but Maud grew up knowing there are lines you do not cross. Some are literal: Cross a picket line and you’re a lousy scab. But the figurative lines are drawn just as sharply: Never back management against labor. Never betray the working class. Never put self-interest ahead of the common good. And never, ever fall in love with a Wall Street banker. </p> 
<p>“That’s not fair. You don’t even know him.”</p> 
<p>“You’re right. I don’t know him. May I ask, then, what it is precisely that your Tom does on Wall Street?”</p> 
<p>“He works for a hedge fund.” Maud nearly shouts it, somehow feeling defiant and defiled at the same time. </p> 
<p>“A hedge fund.”</p> 
<p>“It’s not what you’re thinking.”</p> 
<p>“Oh, I’m pretty sure it’s exactly what I’m thinking. A hedge fund. So he helps the already-rich get even richer, is that it? He’s an agent of concentrated wealth. Or is this doddering old Red mixing up his capitalist tools?” He pours himself more wine, ignoring Maud’s nearly empty glass.</p> 
<p>She flares. “He’s not like that. He’s not like you’re making him out to be. He’s a good man with a big heart and I love him and I’m going to marry him.”
<p>“He’s a capitalist. Worse than that, he’s a capitalist’s capitalist.”</p> 
<p>“Not every capitalist is a monster. No more than every communist is a saint.”</p> 
<p>They glare at each other across the table. It’s stalemate. Macklavore is furious and grief-stricken and terribly afraid that he’s lost his daughter. Maud is hurt and angry and terribly afraid of losing her father. But she also knows that whatever happens, Tom stays. She recalls Ned’s words, the night she called from New York to forewarn him and ask his advice: “In the end, what he wants is your happiness. He may love the proletariat, but he loves you more.” If she can just steer the conversation away from the old man’s inflexible ideology.</p> 
<p>Before she can say anything, though, Macklavore is pushing a small, gift-wrapped box across the table. “Here,” he says, still scowling, “you might as well have this anyway. Happy May Day.”</p> 
<p>It’s a necklace, gold plated and inexpensive – cheap, to be blunt – probably plucked from a Fisherman’s Wharf bargain bin down by the union hall. Over the years, as age and circumstances have worn him down, his gifts have become increasingly modest. But he never misses Maud’s birthday and he never misses a May Day. She feels herself welling up.</p> 
<p>“It’s not as nice as that thing you were wearing today,” he says, his eyes lowered. Knowing him as she does, Maud understands this is no sympathy ploy. He’s ashamed and feeling diminished. Inside, his guts are probably roiling at the unfairness of a system that allows one man to shower his woman with expensive baubles while reducing her father to expressing his paternal love with a trinket that wouldn’t impress a ten-year old.</p>  
<p>Fastening the necklace, she thanks him and promises to wear it forever. She means it. </p> 
<p>But Tom is still there. </p> 
<p>“If you knew Tom, if you took the time to really know him, you’d like him, Daddy. I know you would.”</p> 
<p>Macklavore stiffens at her mention of the name. He’s the immovable object to Tom’s irresistible force. </p> 
<p>“No.”</p> 
<p>“No? No, what?”</p> 
<p>“I can’t stop you from marrying him if you’re hellbent. But I’m not going to know him. He is who he is and I am who I am. If you can find some way to fit yourself between us and reconcile the differences, then good for you. Let’s just leave it at that.” </p> 
<p>But Maud has no intention of leaving it at that. She has already mapped out a future for the three of them, aimed principally at getting Macklavore out of his miserable little room and into a place where he can be comfortable in his last years. Tom and Maud will remain in the east but Tom has agreed to finance the purchase of a two-bedroom condominium, although he nearly balked after taking a closer look at the San Francisco market. (“This one in Visitacion Valley doesn’t sound too bad. No? Why not?”) One bedroom will be for his new wife’s crazy communist father and the other for the happy couple on their visits to the coast.  </p> 
<p>“Tom is the sweetest man I know. He’s generous and he’s kind. You have no right…”</p> 
<p>“He can be Gandhi for all I care. Look. People die every day in this world because of the economic and political decisions being made by the elites who invest their ill-gotten millions with your Tom. No ethical man works for scum like that. Sorry.”</p> 
<p>“You’re drunk.”</p> 
<p>“Not too drunk. But I will be.”</p> 
<p>They settle up and walk home in silence. Macklavore smokes while Maud stares blindly down the street, refusing to cry.</p>  

<p>The next morning Macklavore is alone at the cafe.</p> 
<p>“You said <i>what</i>?” Ned thrusts his face right up into the old man’s bloodshot eyes.</p> 
<p>“I said she was a quisling.”</p> 
<p>“Don’t you think that’s a little over the top?”</p> 
<p>Macklavore, rocky from a red-wine hangover, buries his head in his hands. He slowly gathers himself, searching for a pulse.</p>  
<p>“Well?”</p> 
<p>“She knows what kind of man he is, Ned.”</p> 
<p>“I’m quite sure she does know, since she’s going to marry the guy. You’re the one who has no idea.”</p> 
<p>“Can you, maybe … can you back off a little?”</p> 
<p>“Where is she now?”</p> 
<p>“She’s gone to stay with a friend. I think she’s going back to New York today.”</p> 
<p>“And is this how you want it to end? With Maud walking out of your life forever?” Ned shakes Macklavore’s shoulder, causing him to sit up and snarl. <p>“Over a political disagreement? You’re going to turn your back on the most important person in your life because her fiancé hasn’t been approved by the Politburo?”</p> 
<p>“I gave her solid values, Ned.”</p> 
<p>“But you didn’t give her a chance to demonstrate those values. You shut her out and wouldn’t listen. Now you listen to me. Maud isn’t marrying this guy because of what he does for a living. She found love, Jack. Remember love? She’s thirty-whatever and she finally meets someone … a partner, a lover … a <i>comrade</i>, Jack.”</p> 
<p>Macklavore winces, possibly from the hangover. “Don’t use that word.”</p> 
<p>“Oh, fuck all. She loves the man, not the suit, and he obviously loves her. He has to know her politics – not to mention yours – and he probably doesn’t care. Don’t you trust your own daughter’s judgment? Do you think she’d marry someone just to rub your nose in it? Don’t piss all over her happiness now. She deserves better from you. Keep your eye on the ball here.”</p> 
<p>Macklavore cups his chin in his hands and pouts.</p> 
<p>“I swear, Jack, you’re more rigid than a fucking priest. Tell the girl you’re sorry for being an ass and let her be happy.”</p> 

<p>They reconcile, awkwardly. He apologizes and asks her to come back to his squalid little room. For the sake of both love and loyalty, she does. At first they avoid the subject of Thomas-who-goes-by-Tom. They go to the movies and they hang out at the cafe under Ned’s sternly benevolent gaze. But the bonhomie is forced and through the strain Macklavore sees her unhappiness. It’s more than he can stand.</p> 
<p>On her last night in town they return to the cellar at Tommaso’s. He wastes no time.</p> 
<p>“You’re determined to marry Tom, then?”</p> 
<p>Maud tears up but her chin remains firm. “Yes, I am. He’s a good man, no matter what you think.”</p> 
<p>Macklavore nods. “It’s been suggested to me that he might be, yes.”</p> 
<p>She sends a silent thank you to Ned. He’s done his job, apparently, like one of those go-between characters Shakespeare used to write into his comedies. When she left her father that first night she called Ned straight away. He calmed her down, told her to lie low and do nothing rash, and to let him take it from there. </p> 
<p>“Ned tells me that Tom spends a lot of time volunteering with the disadvantaged.”</p> 
<p>Well, Shakespeare’s characters weren’t above exaggerating, either, but she plays along. “Yes. Yes, he does. As much as he can.”</p> 
<p>“Then it seems I’ve misjudged the lad.” Macklavore doesn’t believe he’s misjudged anyone but is happy to let Maud think he has.</p> 
<p>“I’ve told him about you, you know. About who you are and what you believe and what you’ve fought for all your life. He thinks you’re dreaming of a Utopia that can never exist but he respects your convictions. Do you think I’d marry a man who didn’t?”</p> 
<p>Macklavore seems to consider this, and then raises his glass. “Here’s to Thomas-who-goes-by-Tom, then, and to his loving comrade, Maud. <i>Nostrovia</i>.” They drink deeply and, perhaps, even happily.</p> 
<p>“Then we have your blessing?”</p> 
<p>“I don’t know. Can an atheist bestow a blessing? Maybe I’ll just make Tom a Hero of Socialist Labor. Will that do?”
<p>She blows him a kiss. </p> 
<p>When the check arrives, Macklavore grins and hands it to Maud. “You’re the one with the fancy credit card.” He gets up, strolls around the table and kisses her on the forehead. “I gotta pee. Make sure you leave a good tip.”</p> 
<p id="chapter">*</p> 
<p>The cancer that gets him is buried deep in his lungs, even before Maud returns to New York. It spreads quickly. He grows frail, seeming to collapse in on himself a little more each day. Maud returns to San Francisco to care for him during the final stages. When it’s over there is a private memorial at the cafe and a larger, more public one, in Washington Square. Members of the ILWU ring the park in a gesture of fraternal solidarity. Some of Macklavore’s musical friends, accompanied by a few sympathetic ringers from the Green Street Mortuary Band, play the “Internationale.” The mourners sing it first in English and then, for the few who can manage it, in Russian. Maud, standing tear-stained in the middle of the green between Ned and Thomas-who-goes-by-Tom, sings both versions in a strong, clear voice.</p> 
<p>When the memorial ends some of the mourners form a straggly conga line behind the band and march down Columbus Avenue to the pyramid office tower. There, Macklavore’s Party comrades stage a little guerrilla theater, projecting their red banner, with its yellow hammer and sickle, onto the alabaster façade of the city’s most visible capitalist symbol. A few starchy types object and there’s a minor fuss in the papers and on the blogs, but this is Jack’s night.</p> 
<p>Macklavore has left specific instructions for winding things up – “orders from Moscow,” he called it with a fading morphine grin – and Maud sees to it that they’re carried out. There’s no funeral, no barbaric ritual, to use Macklavore’s words. His clothes are given to a local agency for the homeless, in the hope of giving warmth to some shivering, starving giant. His books are donated to the ILWU library, his art to charity. </p>

<p>As for Macklavore, he is cremated. Dividing her father’s ashes into three small urns, Maud scatters the contents of the first in Washington Square, her father’s favorite refuge in North Beach. She gives the second to Chick, one of the morning coffee slingers at the cafe, who draws a little red star on the urn and tucks it high up and way back in a discreet spot, where Macklavore can keep an eye on things. The third urn Maud takes to Steuart and Mission streets, down along the San Francisco waterfront, and on a windy night releases its contents to mingle with the ghosts of Nick Bordoise and Howard Sperry.
