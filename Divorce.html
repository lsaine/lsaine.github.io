	<p>"I want Benny."</p>
 	<p>"Sure."</p>
 	<p>"I mean it, David. I want Benny."</p>
 	<p>"I said sure. OK. Fine. Wunderbar. Roger Willco and out. Benny's all yours."</p>
 	<p>"And the house."</p>
 	<p>"I'm not going to fight you for the house, Sarah. You get Benny, and you get the house."</p>
 	<p>"We'll split our savings, but you'll have to pay support."</p>
 	<p>"The state of California will probably insist, Sarah."</p>
 	<p>"And I want the cafe.”</p>
 	<p>"No."</p>
 	<p>"What?"</p>
 	<p>"I said no. Not the cafe. The Caff&eacute; Trieste is mine. North Beach is full of cafes. You can go find another cafe.”</p>
 	<p>"But all my friends are at the Trieste."</p>
 	<p>"If they're really your friends, they'll follow you over to the Caff&eacute; Roma."</p>
 	<p>"Caff&eacute; Roma? I'm not going to Caff&eacute; Roma. The place is full of assholes. You've said so yourself."</p>
 	<p>"You'll fit right in, then."</p>
 	<p>"David, don't...."</p>
 	<p>"The Caff&eacute; Trieste is mine. That's all there is to it."</p>
 	<p>"This is stupid. It's a public place. We can share it."</p>
 	<p>"No. I get the Caff&eacute; Trieste. You can have any other cafe that you like."</p>
 	<p>"You're being unreasonable."</p>
 	<p>"You didn't start going to the Trieste until I took you there. I was hanging out there while you were still in high school. The Trieste is mine."</p>
 	<p>"This is ridiculous."</p>
 	<p>"Is it?"</p>
 	<p>"Yes, David, it is. It's absolutely childish."</p>
 	<p>"The Trieste is the one place I can call my own. I go there to have peace and to be with my friends. And with you taking the house, it will literally be my living room now."</p>
 	<p>"I have friends th....."</p>
 	<p>"No, Sarah. The Caff&eacute; Trieste is mine. This is non-negotiable. You will have to find another place to go."</p>
	<p>"I have as much right to be there as you do."</p>
	<p>"You? You have less right to be there than practically anybody who goes there."</p>
	<p>"How dare you....What do you mean by that?"</p>
	<p>"You met lover boy there, didn't you? That's why we're standing here today."</p>
	<p>"Don't be cruel."</p>
	<p>"Why not? You were."</p>
	<p>"David, it was just one of those things. It just happened."</p>
	<p>"You trashed everything we had for the sake of what? A guy with a bigger cock?"</p>
	<p>"Don't cheapen it, David. You know it's not that way."</p>
	<p>"I don't care what way it is. You destroyed this marriage and kicked me to the curb for a cheap lay. Well, you can have him. But I get the cafe."</p>
	<p>"You don't make the rules."</p>
	<p>"Let me put it this way. If I see you and him in there together, I'll kill him."</p>
	<p>"You wouldn't."</p>
	<p>"Try me."</p>
	<p>"You can't kill him. You can't kill anybody. You were at Woodstock."</p>
	<p>"I can kill him. Only some warped sense of honor keeps me from killing you. But I can kill him." </p>
	<p>"Now you're being melodramatic."</p>
	<p>"A cuckold can be forgiven some minor theatrics. But I mean it, Sarah. I'll kill him."</p>
	<p>"Listen. It doesn't have to be this way. We can share custody of Benny. A boy needs his father, too."</p>
	<p>"But we can't share the Trieste. The cafe is mine."</p>
	<p>"And we can sell the house and split the proceeds. I don't mind renting for a while."</p>
	<p>"You're pretty generous all of a sudden. Why?"</p>
	<p>"I wanted to tell you this earlier. It's only fair that we should split everything down the middle." </p>
	<p>"You're offering me shared custody of Benny and half the proceeds on the house? For the Caff&eacute; Trieste?"</p>
	<p>"We can share everything, David. Even the cafe."</p>
	<p>"No deal."</p>
	<p>"What do you mean, 'No deal'?"</p>
	<p>"It's all or nothing, Sarah. If you want the cafe, you have to give up Benny and the house. Completely."</p>
	<p>"That's insane."</p>
	<p>"That's the deal. Take it or leave it."</p>
	<p>"Benny and the house for the cafe?"</p>
	<p>"Right. A straight swap."</p>
	<p>"That's completely unfair."</p>
	<p>"That's the offer. Take it or leave it."</p>
	<p>"All right."</p>
	<p>"All right what?"</p>
	<p>"All right, David. I'll take the deal."</p>
	<p>"You're giving me Benny and the house so you can have the cafe?"</p>
	<p>"I guess I am."</p>
	<p>"You got a deal. We'll put it in writing."</p>
	<p>"So I get the cafe."</p>
	<p>"And I get the house and the kid and the Caff&eacute; Roma."</p>
	<p>"With all the other assholes."</p>
	<p>"Ha. Yeah. With all of them. OK. Done. Let's have a drink to seal the deal."</p>
	<p>"Really?"</p>
	<p>"Sure. You know, the funny thing is, I never liked the Trieste that much anyway."</p>
