<h2 id="title">November Light</h2>
<p id="author">&copy; 2016 Anthony Long</p>

<p>He watches the couple walking the square's meandering footpath in the soft light of a late November afternoon. Their small dog, a Jack Russell terrier, dances out in front of them through the falling yellow leaves but they pay him no mind. They're definitely lovers, new lovers, he tells himself, although neither is especially young. But they aren't old, either, and the watcher imagines their lovemaking being tender and considerate, as his had been, punctuated by energetic bursts of passion. As his had been. His lips recede into a thin, straight line. He continues watching.</p> 

<p>The sun reclines against the western hill, a pallid disk casting its heatless light across Washington Square and bathing Coit Tower and the houses on Telegraph Hill in an amber glow. The lovers walk on, oblivious to everything but each other. They follow the path in dappled sunlight as it turns to run parallel to Union Street and she suddenly grips the man's arm before laying her head against his shoulder. It's an expression of pleasure and affection and as the watcher trails along at a discreet distance he grows melancholy, remembering a woman called Joanna and the things he once felt.</p>

<p>Halcyon days, he thinks to himself, raising an imaginary glass to happiness. And then he scribbles a few more lines in a small black notebook.</p>

<p>Now the wind blows in off the Pacific, causing the watcher to turn up his collar and bury his hands in the deep pockets of his overcoat. It's still too early for the Alaskan currents, but he's shivering. The cold affects him more than it used to. He ignores the dull ache in his lower back and continues watching the lovers as they make another circuit of the park. They don't appear to feel the cold at all. He notes, with interest, her lightness of step. He observes how often her smile comes, how it brightens her broadly pretty face, and how long it lingers. She laughs easily, too. Not the belly laugh that comes from hearing a good joke, not the kind that mocks, nothing ironic. It's the laugh of a woman in love: lighthearted, almost giddy. Even from a distance he can tell the man isn't saying anything especially clever or amusing; he doesn't appear to be saying much of anything at all. She's laughing for the sheer joy of being alive.</p>

<p>The man is nicely dressed, trim and athletic-looking. He has the healthy ruddiness of someone who spends a lot of time out of doors, sailing on the bay, perhaps, or volleying at his tennis club. He smiles a lot, too, through white, even teeth. Whether the man is in love or not is hard to ascertain, but he’s clearly enjoying himself. The Jack Russell darts in and out of the bushes and charges the falling leaves, oblivious to both and obedient to neither. Now and then he runs back to them, circling and barking, trying to goad someone into throwing an invisible ball that is apparently hidden inside a coat pocket. After a while, the man shoos him away good-naturedly and the lovers continue their stroll.</p>

<p>The watcher stands under a tree as they turn up the path and walk away from him. With their backs to him, he lets his gaze wander. The leaves are pretty but not as pretty as the leaves of his native New England. With every gust of wind more of them flutter, like golden flakes, to the ground. It's the light, though, that makes the lasting impression; there is no light in New England quite like this. Here, it softens all the hard edges, the way white paint mixed with yellow softens the corner of a canvas splashed in vivid colors. He thinks about November turning inexorably into December and how it signifies a winding down, an approaching end to things. As the lovers circle back in his direction he sees only a beginning. Joanna creeps into his thoughts again making him remember how their own dark December set in. </p>

<p>It took her ages to work up the nerve to leave but when she did, even though he could see it coming like a pair of high-beam headlights, it killed him. Twenty years on – twenty years, he mumbles to himself – and the memory of her still burns. Something in the woman he's watching this afternoon reminds him of Joanna. It's not a physical resemblance, but there's something. Something about her, about her manner or her stride or the way, sometimes, she tosses her hair as she walks. Then he decides. It's the way she's breaking free and finding something better. </p>

<p>On their next circuit, the watcher notices that the woman has drawn her coat more tightly around her. The temperature has started dropping as the sun slips behind the apartment towers on Russian Hill. It will be dusk soon. Wispy low clouds pass quickly overhead, throwing shadows like fast-moving ghosts across the expanse of lawn. She calls to the dog, who comes to within arm's reach before bounding away. She calls him again, and again he comes tantalizingly close, only to sprint off at the last moment. It looks like a familiar game that the two play; she's laughing. On the fifth go-round, the dog drops at her feet and she snaps the leash on. Arm in arm in the gathering twilight, the lovers leave Washington Square.</p>

<p>The watcher follows them, again at a discreet distance. She's holding the leash and the man has his arm around her. They walk down Columbus Avenue to the Caff&eacute; Trieste, where they tether the Jack Russell to a newspaper box before going inside. The watcher lingers at the corner for a bit, to let them settle in. After five minutes or so, he casually walks past the cafe. The lovers are seated at a table against the window, hot chocolates to one side, as they hold hands and gaze into each other's eyes. The watcher decides that he’s seen enough.</p>

<p>He's around the corner at the Caff&eacute; Puccini, having coffee. He imagines Joanna sitting across from him, reaching for his hands and smiling into his eyes. In a weak moment he allows himself to be warmed by the thought. But Joanna is long gone and the reverie doesn't last. He snaps open the notebook and reads his narrative. He's earned his money today. He punches a number into his cell phone. The voice that answers is immediately plaintive, querulous, in the way that a man would be who is sure he's being cuckolded and is willing to pay a hundred bucks an hour for confirmation. The watcher listens, not without sympathy, but he's wavering. The man's whining irritates him and he can't get the woman’s happiness out of his head. Still, he doesn't decide until there’s a pause at the other end.</P>

	<p>"Nah," he says. "Nothin'. She's just out walking the dog."</p>
