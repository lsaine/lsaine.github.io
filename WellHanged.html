<h2 id="title">Well Hanged</h2>
<p id="author"> &copy; 2016 Anthony Long</p>


	<p>Walking down that dimly lit alley in the wee hours of a foggy Thursday, I chanced upon a man dangling from a lamppost. He had been hanged but was still alive, twitching and gurgling every now and then as he swung to and fro in a lively breeze.</p> 

	<p>I reckoned his executioner must be something of a sadist. He had chosen to use a thin wire, rather than a stout rope or a nylon cord, knowing, I'm sure, that wire works very slowly, sawing through blood vessels and sinew as it tightens, while at the same time strangling its victim in small, excruciating increments. That’s how Hitler got rid of the generals who tried to blow him up, and some of them took hours to die. </p>

	<p>There was no way of telling exactly how long this wretch had been hanging there, but by the look of him I’d say it had been some time. The collar of his linen dress shirt was blood-soaked and the top half of his crimson-and-blue rep tie, still knotted at his throat, was darkly stained, too. He stank. He had voided himself, soiling his slacks while the trail of stink dribbled into the tops of his highly polished calfskin shoes. His feet were low enough to the ground that even in the murky lamplight I could, if I wrinkled my nose and held my breath, read the Ferragamo label on the soles. Some of the stink overflowed his shoe tops and dripped into the street, mingling with the blood pooling beneath him. His tongue, purple and blood-flecked, jutted from his lips like a lewd sausage. There was more blood coming from his tightly bound wrists, where, again, wire had been used in preference to rope. His eyes bulged from his sockets to the point of bursting. They darted around from time to time – I’m pretty sure he knew I was there – but mostly he stared straight ahead. He was beyond speech but every now and then he made some funny, choking noises. And once in a while he’d jiggle involuntarily, like a dying fish flopping in a bucket. </p>

	<p>"Joe," I called out to him, for it happened I knew him from the neighborhood. "What on earth are you doing up there?" Of course, I knew perfectly well what he was doing up there. It was just a matter of figuring out who had strung him up. The cops working this case would have their work cut out for them, that’s for sure. It would be tough narrowing the field of suspects, because Joe, being Joe, it might be any one of a hundred people. Plenty of folks would give a lot to be standing where I was standing right now, just to admire the view.</p>

	<p>He made a sound like a whale clearing its blowhole. </p>

	<p>Joe was a real estate speculator. That’s how he made his money: buying up apartment buildings around San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood and evicting the tenants, or bribing them or harassing them until they left, so he could spin apartments into condominiums and sell them off at astronomical prices to outsiders with wads of dough stuffed in their pants. When someone would criticize him for the way he made his living, Joe got defensive, saying things like, “Hold on, there. I’m creating housing. I’m making it possible for people to live the American dream.” Of course, he didn’t care that in creating the American dream for people who had the means of dreaming anywhere they liked, he was destroying the dreams of people who had no place else to go. He didn’t care that maybe you’d lived in the same apartment for twenty-five years and this was your neighborhood and these were your friends and he was kicking you out to make way for some newly moneyed tech whiz-kid from Orinda who thought, gee, wouldn’t it be awesome to live in North Beach for a few years. If you threw that in his face, he’d just smirk at you from behind his rosy apple cheeks as if to say, well, tough shit. </p>

<p>Joe lived large up on Telegraph Hill. He had bought a cottage up there a while back, when all his wheeling and dealing started paying off. The cottage was small and quite old but it had a tidy charm, in the way that many of the old shanties up there used to have before the wealthy barged in and leveled them. The cottage was surrounded by a nice little garden. It survived the 1906 earthquake and fire, but it couldn’t survive Joe. After several years of careful neglect, he connived with his cronies at City Hall to get the cottage declared a tear-down. Then he bulldozed it and built himself a grand, four-unit condominium building, taking the grandest unit for himself. Since there was no longer room for a garden, he had them put in a roof deck. Leaning on his parapet, Joe commanded a view that looked west across North Beach to Russian Hill and all the way out to the Golden Gate. </p>

	<p>His office was at the bottom of the hill, on Grant Avenue. Even though the office was only about three or four blocks from his house, Joe always drove his big Mercedes to work. He had his own parking place, too, which, in a tightly packed neighborhood like North Beach, said as much about Joe as anything else. He’d stride down the street like an Ottoman pasha, dressed to the nines, very often accompanied by an attractive woman. (Although rarely the same attractive woman.) </p>

<p>Now Joe didn’t want to be thought of as a bad guy, so when he threw his lavish parties up there on the hill he always made a point of inviting all kinds of people from the neighborhood, many who came even though they were renters and knew what Joe was. I’m ashamed to admit that I went to one of those parties, once. Of course, he’d also invite his creepy friends from the titty bars down on Broadway, and they’d show up with their strippers and their blow. But even with all the sleaze hanging around, Joe just wanted everyone to see him as a regular guy. </p>

<p>Except he wasn’t a regular guy. He was ruthless, and cared only for money. He combined this greed-lust with a killer’s instinct, selecting his properties very shrewdly, choosing buildings that would be easy to flip while avoiding places where the tenants would be hard to evict because of some stupid, misguided city law. Old people, for example, presented a problem because the city wasn’t comfortable just dumping them into the street. But they were also easier to manipulate and intimidate, and no one was better than Joe at twisting an arm. He’d gotten rid of plenty of coots and geezers. He didn’t bat an eye when it came to evicting a cripple. He’d kicked out everyone from artists and musicians to retired merchant seamen and single mothers. Only last month, he finally got rid of the sweet but addled woman – someone said she was a schoolteacher somewhere – who lived on the top floor of his Greenwich Street property. She was the last tenant to leave. She lost some of her sweetness and she didn’t go quietly, but in the end she did go. Contractors were swarming all over the place by the following Monday. </p>

<p>In the course of ten years, I’d say Joe was either directly involved in, or had a hand in, more than two dozen evictions in North Beach alone. </p>

<p>One of those angry, displaced tenants strung Joe up in that alley, no doubt about it.</p> 

	<p>I was still pondering all the things that made Joe Joe, when, suddenly, from way down deep inside of him, came a sound I'd never heard before. I hope never to hear it again, at least not in anyone else. I suppose it was just Joe announcing the Big Adios, Joe giving up the ghost. There was a kind of rumble, like an earthquake, and then a strangled shriek. A rattling sound came next, followed by the hiss of escaping air. Then, silence. Joe's eyes were still open, but they no longer bulged so much. They were flat and glassy and they stared sightlessly down the alley. His bloated tongue hung loosely from his blood-encrusted lips. He still twisted in the breeze, but more slowly now. Joe had gone dead-weight slack. </p>

	<p>Clearly, there was nothing more to be done here. “See ya, Joe,” I said, tossing him a wave over my shoulder as I continued on my way.</p>
